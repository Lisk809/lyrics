{"name":"NIGHT DANCER(English Ver.)","cover":"imase","content":["Don&#x27;t need a change yeah","Just stay the same yeah","Looking back the only one I saw was you","All the words we don&#x27;t say","And the look on your face","And our time&#x27;s running out","So just breathe it all out","Ah let&#x27;s dance the night away","Don&#x27;t ever change yeah","Just stay the same yeah","Every time you look at me","I can feel the memories","Stirring up in my heart like coffee","And every word you say to me","Replays like a melody","Before I let you go dance with me","Ah let&#x27;s dance the night away","Ah I just need your lovin&#x27;","Ah let&#x27;s dance the night away"],"song":"47834"}
