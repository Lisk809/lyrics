{"name":"Iâ€™m Not Alone(Burns Rewerk)","cover":"Calvin Harris","content":["Can you stay up for the weekend","And blame god for looking too old","Can you find all that you stand for","You cannot dream yourself to notice","To feel pain and swallow fear","But can you stay up for the weekend","For next year","God I can&#x27;t do this any more","As many feet walk through the door","I&#x27;m not alone","If I see a light flashing","If I see a man waving","Does this mean that I&#x27;m not alone","If I see a light flashing","If I see a man waving","Does this mean that I&#x27;m not alone","No?","If I see a light flashing","If I see a man waving","Does this mean that I&#x27;m not alone","If I see a light flashing","If I see a man waving","Does this mean that I&#x27;m not alone"],"song":"13681"}
