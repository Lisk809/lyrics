{"name":"Blow","cover":"王嘉尔","content":["You taste like cigarettes","I hit it every chance I get","Girl you got me dripping sweat","You pull me back every time I quit","Yea","You taste like cigarettes","Your body feels like disrespect","Let you play me like an instrument","My dirty secret that keeps me awake","Ohhhhh","You taste like cigarettes","I got a problem think I&#x27;m into it","I take a hit and let it burn my lips","My dirty secret that keeps me awake","Ohhhhh","BLOW!","You got me blowing away","I&#x27;ll do anything","Tell me what to do","Ooh ooh ooh","Twinkle twinkle where&#x27;s the star","Passed out in the back of my car","Blacked out from the night before","How&#x27;d we let it get this far?"],"song":"25347"}
