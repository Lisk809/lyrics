{"name":"Lullaby For Love","cover":"Groove Coverage","content":["I see the soul in my eyes","All that remains is the pain inside","The memories of time that were lies","They told me time is a healer","Healing hearts to bleed","But it can put a smile on my face","And I don&#x27;t wanna wait","This is my lullaby for love","And I hope it will never wake up","This is my last goodnight kiss","To save me always from my tears","My way of life changed because of you","They told me time is a healer","Healing hearts to bleed","And someone sing my song","This is my lullaby for love","And I hope it will never wake up","This is my last goodnight kiss","This is my lullaby for love","And I hope it will never wake up","This is my last goodnight kiss","To save me always from my tears","This is my last goodnight kiss","To save me always","From my tears"],"song":"20833"}
