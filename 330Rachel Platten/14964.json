{"name":"Take These Things Away","cover":"Rachel Platten","content":["Make being awake like living in a dream","Maybe there&#x27;s someone","When my song has slipped away","And the darkness swallows the day","Baby just hold on","Maybe there&#x27;s someone","When my song has slipped away","And the darkness swallows the day","Baby just hold on","If you could see behind my eyes","Indigo and ivory","Overwhelmed in outer space","Spinning round and round and chasing","Fairy tales and shooting stars","How I wonder where we are","In this life we&#x27;ll be alright","All we gotta do is hold on tight","Maybe there&#x27;s someone","When my song has slipped away","And the darkness swallows the day","Just hold on"],"song":"14964"}
