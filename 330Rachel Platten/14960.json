{"name":"Donâ€™t Care What Time It Is","cover":"Rachel Platten","content":["Poets and painters and daytime escapers","Tell us a story of what we once knew","Paint us a picture of some great excuse","We are everything we own  right","And the second that we don&#x27;t fight","Is the moment that we own life","Keep it up  keep it up  oh","We don&#x27;t care what time it is","No one here is fightin&#x27; this","If the DJ keeps on finding hits","We could keep this going for days","We don&#x27;t care what time it is","No one here is fightin&#x27; this","If the DJ keeps on finding hits","We could keep this going for days","The only real moment is this","Bring your body in to the beach again","You are everything we own","Is the moment that you own life","Keep it up  keep it up  oh","We don&#x27;t care what time it is","No one here is fightin&#x27; this","If the DJ keeps on finding hits","We could keep this going for days","We don&#x27;t care what time it is","No one here is fightin&#x27; this","If the DJ keeps on finding hits","We could keep this going for days","The only real moment is this","So they lead you to the beach again","Heat is getting to your head you think","You are everything you own  right","So the second that you don&#x27;t fight","Is the moment that you own life","Keep it up  keep it up  oh","We don&#x27;t care what time it is","No one here is fightin&#x27; this","If the DJ keeps on finding hits","We could keep this going for days","We don&#x27;t care what time it is","No one here is fightin&#x27; this","If the DJ keeps on finding hits","We could keep this going for days","The only real moment is this"],"song":"14960"}
