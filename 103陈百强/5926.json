{"name":"First Love","cover":"陈百强","content":["Once upon a dream","My love and I lived inside a smile","The time was nigh","We broke down and we cried","Rcfriending dragonflies","Lullabyes and funny little rides","We&#x27;d spend the night time","Counting countless stars","Choking on our stolen first cigar","There is no reason no rhyme","No need of keeping track of time","First love ensnared my mind","Wonderland was waiting","Butterflies went fluttering by","One by one","Good time had just begun","Quite lost in a trance","My love and I lost in loving dance","Turning around and turning again","Never knowing it had to end","There is no future no past","Your first love won&#x27;t be your last","There is no future no past","Your first love won&#x27;t be your last"],"song":"5926"}
