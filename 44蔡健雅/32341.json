{"name":"I’ll Remember You","cover":"蔡健雅","content":["Sorry wasn&#x27;t good enough","A song without meter and rhyme","A candle flame dies in the wind","Spirals from your cigarette","Your sweet cologne on my pillow","Pretty pictures on the wall","Hopes in us will rise and fall","Rise and fall","And in the rain in summer days too","When the willow tree weeps too","Under the street light so bright","I&#x27;ll remember you everyday","The plane leaves in an hour&#x27;s time","Hold me till our last goodbye","Silence is the only sound","No words can speak it through","And in the rain","In summer days too","When the willow tree weeps too","Under the street lights so bright","I&#x27;ll remember you","I&#x27;ll remember you","I&#x27;ll remember you","Everyday"],"song":"32341"}
