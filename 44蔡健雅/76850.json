{"name":"I Don&#x27;t Know Where I Stand","cover":"蔡健雅","content":["Funny day looking for laughter","and finding it there","Sunny day braiding wild flowers","and leaves in my hair","Picked up a pencil and wrote","Wanted to send it","but I don&#x27;t know where I stand","Telephone even the sound of","your voice is still new","And feeling too foolish and strange","to say the words that I had planned","I guess it&#x27;s too early","Crickets call courting their ladies","Thickets tall until the morning","comes up like a dream","All muted and misty","I know that I miss you","but I don&#x27;t know where I stand","I know that I miss you","but I don&#x27;t know where I stand"],"song":"76850"}
