{"name":"Lost","cover":"蔡健雅","content":["I never knew what I had lost","Till you were thousand miles away","I laid out all the memories","Wandering why I pushed you away","Tell all the damage had been done","Then knew I&#x27;d lost the best of me","Cos you loved me the most","Cos you knew me the most","I close my eyes so I won&#x27;t see","Shattered dreams and broken hearts","Oh then I&#x27;ll get carried away","Putting them back together","Yet they never looked so incomplete","Cos you loved me the most","Cos you knew me the most","Was love just passing by","Were we only not meant to be","I just don&#x27;t want to believe","Cos you loved me the most","Cos you knew me the most"],"song":"32232"}
