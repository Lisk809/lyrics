{"name":"舞步 Heartbeat","cover":"蔡健雅","content":["旅途之中有却步 言语背后有意图","我们乍看在共处 其实到处起冲突","争论对错的速度 大于心跳的起伏","最后只剩下皮肤 还保有感触","你若是向前 我退一步","一个眼神 就能解读","我怀念那时 和谐双人舞","现在你转身 我不投入","这一首歌 无法同步","谁该主动认输","Know that my heart is beating","But I know that my heart is bleeding","Know that my heart is beating","视线错开的角度 缺乏灵魂的温度","一蹶不振的周五 还不算穷途末路","如果终究要落幕 何必随着爱起舞","当初就让它当初 不该再回顾","你若是向前 我退一步","一个眼神 就能解读","而默契再好 也是要结束","现在你转身 我不投入","这一首歌 无法同步","我该主动认输","Know that my heart is beating","But I know that my heart is bleeding","Know that my heart is beating","Is beating","But I know that my heart is bleeding","Know that my heart is beating","试着好好走路 停止总想与人共舞","到最后一塌糊涂 又一塌糊涂","总是给人祝福 何时轮到我被祝福","快点结束这一出 在演哪一出","Know that my heart is beating","But I know that my heart is bleeding","Know that my heart is beating","Is beating","But I know that my heart is bleeding","Know that my heart is beating"],"song":"32377"}
