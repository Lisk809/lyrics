{"name":"Ashes","cover":"蔡健雅","content":["I looked around for life","For something to hold me back in time","Yearning waiting to","Break into the silence of the night","A thousand troubled lies","Trapped within truth and confusion","Forgive me","Maybe for the words I chose to say","If I should fall","Into your arms","Would I feel insecure","I&#x27;m so far away","But too close so you say","Funny why we make peace and love","Once again there&#x27;s nothing to feel","I&#x27;m sheltered from the light","Hiding behind this shady vision","Holding the wind","If I should fall","Into your arms","Would I feel insecure","I&#x27;m so far away","But too close so you say","Funny why we make peace and love","Once again there&#x27;s nothing to feel","Every now and then you move me","All the ashes in my eyes","And I want to","So if you are thinking of running away","Let me run with you"],"song":"32204"}
