{"name":"Until Next Time","cover":"蔡健雅","content":["Drunk on my sobriety","Driven by your insanity","Made to stumble in my formative years","Care to spare me a minute","Could I be alone for awhile","Fortunately you were out of my way","Until next time","Until next life","Never knew you&#x27;d hurt me","Now you crave for sincerity","So it&#x27;s just imagination","Was it bad now really","When the sex has lost all its charm","So it&#x27;s just to my elation","Until next time","Until next life","I&#x27;ll wear my clothes right","I&#x27;ll sleep on the other side","I&#x27;ll say what&#x27;s necessary","Until next time","I&#x27;ll wear my clothes right","I&#x27;ll sleep on the other side","I&#x27;ll say what&#x27;s necessary","Until next time"],"song":"32310"}
