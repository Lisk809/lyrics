{"name":"Coming Home","cover":"Emilia","content":["We left our loves and friends behind,","It&#x27;s time to say goodbye","Hear the call of waves,","Silence conquer mind","Sailing under pale moonlight","And chasing Northern star","We face the secrets of the dark","Yeah, I&#x27;m coming home again","We rope the sails, cold winds of north","Lead us through the rain","Yeah, come hell or high water","I will survive,","This ocean will not be my grave","......","Standing in the pelting rain,","The clouds are painted black","From far away we hear the sound,","So gently buoys ring","We catch the note and turn the ship","Across the stormy seas,","We sail and still believe","We touched the edge of world,","I&#x27;m ready to return","Yeah, I&#x27;m coming home again","We rope the sails,","Yeah, come hell or high water","I will survive,","This ocean will not be my grave","......","And in the morning, the hills,","Bright in marble sunlight","I&#x27;m finally home","......","Whoa, oh, I&#x27;m coming home","Whoa, oh, I&#x27;m coming home","Whoa, oh, I&#x27;m coming home","Whoa, oh, I&#x27;m coming home","......"],"song":"71173"}
