{"name":"Monster","cover":"YOASOBI","content":["I&#x27;m trying not to go mad","With stimulation reawaken inclinations","The brighter future knows to reach it","No I cannot be hurting no one","I wanted I wanted to be stronger now","Choking on their own hysteria","Marching with an innocence they proceed","The other side&#x27;s insanity","Oh spill me the tale","Oh spill me the tale","I make a wish alone","The skipping beating in my heart","Go bite into my own and reach it","No I cannot see nobody cry","I wanted I wanted to be stronger now"],"song":"14971"}
