Let It Snow!","cover":"Ingrid Michaelson","content":["Let it snow let it snow","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","Let it snow let it snow","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","Oh the weather outside is frightful","But the fire is so delightful","And since we&#x27;ve no place to go","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","The lights are turned way down low","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","But if you really hold me tight","All the way home I&#x27;ll be warm","And the fire is slowly dying","But as long as you love me so","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","When we snow let it snow","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","Let it snow let it snow","Let it snow let it snow let it snow","But if you really grab me tight","All the way home I&#x27;ll be warm","Oh the fire is slowly dying","But as long as you love me so","Let it snow let it snow","Let the nose with blossom and blow","Let it snow"],"song":"64825"}
