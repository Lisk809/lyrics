{"name":"LOSE (路)","cover":"余佳运","content":["北斗七星指引方向到不了我家","地图上的东海岸线到底有多长","也曾因为贪玩忘了回家","也曾因为自由选择飘向远方","于是背上了装满着期待的行囊","其实也没有那么多文艺的惆怅","只是每每听到新年到来的钟响","为何远方总要跨过海洋","为何梦想总承载着重量","是否只有遍体鳞伤后才算成长","远离了家乡以后","没地方让我停留","原来在梦的尽头","美丽同时也丑陋","我可以独自承受","我也能够","阳光折射的窗口","它握紧了我的双手","早就习惯孤独","任凭自己找着出路","挣脱那些束缚","偶尔也会感到无助","直到万众瞩目","踏上了征途","I have nothing to lose","I have nothing to lose","I have nothing to lose","I have nothing to lose","I have nothing to lose"],"song":"15654"}
