{"name":"I Just Want To Stay With You","cover":"余佳运","content":["I just want to stay with you","无尽长夜中 想象你在左右","时间纵然很自由 无法定格你温柔","我闭上双眼 落入那片黑暗中","梦境之中 若还能见到 你呀","片刻的相见变成 永恒瞬间","时间不为谁 停留","就算你是我无法触碰到的 请记得","命运般的相遇 不会很久","即使会有 分别时候","彼此的心意 你我都能 感受","我会一直在 这里守候","I just want to stay with you","曾在疲惫时 给予我温柔","如同春日阳光 你的双手","那些没有说出的话 是我胆怯了吧","我总在等待 你远方的应答","时间不为谁 停留","就算你是我无法触碰到的 请记得","命运般的相遇 不会很久","即使会有 分别时候","彼此的心意 你我都能 感受","我会一直在 这里守候","I just want to stay with you","每个无法入睡的夜里","悄悄写下心里那一些话语","再多的表达不够","除了唯一留下那一句","I just want to stay with you","不能再将你失去","时间不为谁 停留","就算你是我无法触碰到的 请记得","命运般的相遇 不会很久","即使会有 分别时候","彼此的心意 你我都能 感受","我会一直在 这里守候","I just want to stay with you"],"song":"18953"}
