{"name":"Chasing Shadows","cover":"Shakira","content":["Sunrise blinded by the morning light","Already dreaming up tonight","And I know","That it won&#x27;t be long","Oh  we can&#x27;t hide","From the love that burns this strong","But it&#x27;s just you and me","And we chase our shadows","The sun to go down","But until it does","We&#x27;ll chase our shadows","And when the night comes","We will run from nothing  my love","But it&#x27;s just you and me","And we chase our shadows","The sun to go down","But until it does","We&#x27;ll chase our shadows","And when the night comes","We will run from nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Night time","And I am back in your arms","When all my dreams are brought to life","And I know that it won&#x27;t be long","For we can&#x27;t hide","From the love that burns this strong","But it&#x27;s just you and me","And we chase our shadows","The sun to go down","But until it does","We&#x27;ll chase our shadows","And when the night comes","We will run from nothing  my love","But it&#x27;s just you and me","And we chase our shadows","The sun to go down","But until it does","We&#x27;ll chase our shadows","And when the night comes","We will run from nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love","Nothing  my love"],"song":"24880"}
