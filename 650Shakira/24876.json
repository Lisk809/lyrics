{"name":"The One Thing","cover":"Shakira","content":["Every morning when I woke up","I was stoked up","I was leaving without a purpose","Always jumping all the hurdles","I can&#x27;t explain the way it feels","I could trip on my own words","But I made it here my love","Yeah I made it here my love","You turn the darkness into sun light","And if mess up everything someday","I would hide my head in shame","One thing I got right","One thing I got right","Every morning when you wake up","I wanna hold you","I just need to be wrapped around you","I can&#x27;t explain the way it feels","I could show my own words","Sometimes it feels like getting real","You&#x27;re really here my love","You turn the darkness into sun light","And if I mess up everything someday","I would hide my head in shame","Everytime I see your smile","Everytime I hear your laugh","Baby you bring in new sunshine over now","You are the little dream","As I was a child","May not be here forever","But it&#x27;ll be a long road together","I already know","We&#x27;re gonna be fine  fine  fine","You turn the darkness into sun light","Mess up everything someday","I would hide my head in shame","And if I mess up everything all day","I would hide my head in shame","One thing that I got right","One thing that I got right"],"song":"24876"}
