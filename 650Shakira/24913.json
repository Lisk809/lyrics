{"name":"Gypsy","cover":"Shakira","content":["Broke my heart","Down the road","Spend the weekend","Sewing the pieces back on","Crayons and dolls pass me by","Walking gets too boring","When you learn how to fly","Not the homecoming kind","Take the top off","And who knows what you might find","Won&#x27;t confess all my sins","You can bet I&#x27;ll try it","But you can&#x27;t always win","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a gypsy","But are you coming with me","I might steal your clothes","And wear them if they fit me","I never made agreements","Just like a gypsy","And I won&#x27;t back down","&#x27;Cause life&#x27;s already hurt me","And I won&#x27;t cry","I&#x27;m too young to die","If you&#x27;re gonna quit me","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a gypsy","I can&#x27;t hide","What I&#x27;ve done","Scars remind me","Of just how far that I&#x27;ve come","To whom it may concern","Only run with scissors","When you want to get hurt","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a gypsy","But are you coming with me","I might steal your clothes","And wear them if they fit me","I never made agreements","Just like a gypsy","And I won&#x27;t back down","&#x27;Cause life&#x27;s already hurt me","And I won&#x27;t cry","I&#x27;m too young to die","If you&#x27;re gonna quit me","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a gypsy","And I said hey you","You&#x27;re no fool","If you say &#x27;NO&#x27;","Ain&#x27;t it just the way life goes","People fear what they don&#x27;t know","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a gypsy","But are you coming with me","I might steal your clothes","And wear them if they fit me","I never made agreements","Just like a gypsy","And I won&#x27;t back down","&#x27;Cause life&#x27;s already hurt me","And I won&#x27;t cry","I&#x27;m too young to die","If you&#x27;re gonna quit me","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m a gypsy"],"song":"24913"}
