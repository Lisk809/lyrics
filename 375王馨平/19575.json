{"name":"Wind Beneath My Wings","cover":"王馨平","content":["生活在我的阴影之下想必很冷吧","To never have sunlight on your face","也因此你的脸已长久没有了阳光的滋润","你满足于让我一个人出锋头你一向如此","You always walked a step behind","总是在身后紧紧的跟随着我","So I was the one with all the glory","我拥有了所有的荣耀","而你却拥有力量","作为一个不为人知的人，那么长的时间","A beautiful smile to hide the pain","美丽的微笑下隐藏着痛苦","你会否知道你是我心目中的英雄","And everything I would like to be","我一直渴望自己能和你一样","I can fly higher than an eagle","Cause you are the wind beneath my wings","我双翼下的风你就是我双翼下的风","It might have appeared to go unnoticed","从外表上也许看不出这一切","但对我来说这一切都很清楚","I want you to know","我要你知道","I know the truth of course I know it","我明白事实的真相当然因为我了解你","I would be nothing with out you","没有你我会是一无所有","你会否知道你是我心目中的英雄","你就是那一切一切我所想成就的","I can fly higher than an eagle","Cause you are the wind beneath my wings","我双翼下的风你就是我双翼下的风","You are the wind beneath my wings","那让我能振翅高飞的风"],"song":"19575"}
