{"name":"The Girl With April In Her Eyes","cover":"辛晓琪","content":["For his world was still covered in snow","In his winter fields nothing would grow","Only food and a bed for the night","He ordered his slave to turn her away","The girl with April in her eyes","Oh oh on and on she goes","Hi hi on and on she rides","She rode through the night","Till she came to the light","He brought her inside","By the firelight she died","And he buried her gently and good","Oh the morning was bright","All the world was snow white","Of the girl with April in her eyes","Oh oh on and on she goes","Through the winter&#x27;s night","The wild wind and the snow","Hi hi on and on she flies","She is gone","The girl with April in her eyes"],"song":"48173"}
