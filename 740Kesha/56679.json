{"name":"Bad Dream","cover":"Kesha","content":["I feel like i&#x27;ve been watching","The stars and earth collide","The past&#x27; it haunts me","Yeah it kills me every single time","And now my mind is racing","My heart pounds in my chest","I know i have to let you go","Cause i just can&#x27;t forget","Come wake me up","Come wake me up","Come wake me up","Come wake me up","Come wake me up","I wish i never knew what","I somehow figured out","Lie and tell me you don&#x27;t know","What i&#x27;m talking about","How do i recover","From these pictures in my head","You were the love of my life","I sure hope she was worth it","Come wake me up","Wake me&#x27; hurry","Haunting me every night","Take this bad dream","I can&#x27;t wake up","Come wake me up","Come wake me up"],"song":"56679"}
