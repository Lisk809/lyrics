{"name":"Story of My Life","cover":"One Direction","content":["一笔一划记录在墙上的是那些我无从开口的故事","我将心门敞开但它却再也没有填满的一天","She told me in the morning","今早她开口提起","说深深的对我们之间 感受不再像以前一样","可对我来说有天我随时间消逝 这些字只会硬生的刻划在我心头里","And I&#x27;ll be gone gone tonight","我想今晚的我只会随风消逝","The ground beneath my feet is open wide","我脚下的世界这么虚无","我手里抓得太紧的","With nothing in between","其实什么都没有","The story of my life I take her home","这就是我的故事，如果那天我带她回家","我会开整晚的车，试着让她感受温暖","然后时间就会冻结在这一秒","The story of my life I give her hope","这就是我的故事，我给了她薄弱的希望","我虚耗了她我的爱，直到她早已无法承受","这就是我的故事","木已成舟，墙上的颜色，我无法选择","我的心开敞着，它却象是锁在牢笼里无法移动","I know that in the morning","清晨我得知一切","我从你身旁的那盏灯看见我们的身影","即使我早已破碎 我的心还是向着你","And I&#x27;ll be gone gone tonight","我想今晚的我只会随风消逝","我脚下的烈焰，烧得比阳光还要火热","我手里抓得太紧的","With nothing in between","其实什么都没有","The story of my life I take her home","这就是我的故事，如果那天我带她回家","我会开整晚的车，试着让她感受温暖","然后时间就会冻结在这一秒","The story of my life I give her hope","这就是我的故事，我给了她薄弱的希望","我虚耗了她我的爱，直到她早已无法承受","这就是我的故事","我不断的等待，只为了这一刻","但亲爱的，在你身后追你就好像追着云朵，一样遥不可及","The story of my life I take her home","这就是我的故事，如果那天我带她回家","我会开整晚的车，试着让她感受温暖","Is frozen","然后时间就会冻结","这就是我的故事，我给了她薄弱的希望给了她希望","我虚耗了她我的爱，直到她早已无法承受","The story of my life","这就是我的故事","The story of my life","这就是我的故事"],"song":"22911"}
