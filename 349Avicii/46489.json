{"name":"The Nights(Avicii By Avicii)","cover":"Avicii","content":["Once upon a younger year","When all our shadows disappeared","The animals inside came out to play","Learned our lessons through the tears","Made memories we knew would never fade","One day my father he told me","Son don&#x27;t let it slip away","He took me in his arms I heard him say","When you get older","Think of me if ever you&#x27;re afraid","So live a life you will remember","These are the nights that never die","Die die die die die die die die","When thunder clouds start pouring down","Light a fire they can&#x27;t put out","Don&#x27;t forsake this life of yours","One day my father he told me","Son don&#x27;t let it slip away","When I was just a kid I heard him say","When you get older","Think of me if ever you&#x27;re afraid","So live a life you will remember","These are the nights that never die","Die die die die die die die die"],"song":"46489"}
