{"name":"Sparks Fly","cover":"Taylor Swift","content":["And I&#x27;m a house of cards","You&#x27;re the kind of reckless","That should send me running","And you stood there in front of me","Just close enough to touch","What I was thinking of","Drop everything now","Meet me in the pouring rain","Kiss me on the sidewalk","Take away the pain","My mind forgets to remind me","You&#x27;re a bad idea","But with you I know it&#x27;s no good","Drop everything now","Meet me in the pouring rain","Kiss me on the sidewalk","Take away the pain","Just keep on keeping your eyes on me","And lead me up the staircase","Won&#x27;t you whisper soft and slow","Drop everything now","Meet me in the pouring rain","Kiss me on the sidewalk","Take away the pain","And the sparks fly","Oh baby smile","And the sparks fly"],"song":"80015"}
