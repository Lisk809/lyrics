{"name":"Suburban Legends ","cover":"Taylor Swift","content":["In my peripheral vision","All was quickly forgiven","Flush with the currency of cool","And when it came to you","I didn&#x27;t come here to make friends","We were born to be suburban legends","When you hold me it holds me together","Would surprise the whole school","Walkin&#x27; in with you","With the pages ripped out","I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium","And I can still see you now","I didn&#x27;t come here to make friends","We were born to be suburban legends","When you hold me it holds me together","I know that you still remember","We were born to be national treasures","That my life would be ruined"],"song":"71422"}
