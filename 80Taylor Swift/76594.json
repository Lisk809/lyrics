{"name":"But Daddy I Love Him ","cover":"Taylor Swift","content":["I forget how the West was won","I forget if this was ever fun","Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best","&#x27;Cause they hate you","They slammed the door on my whole world","The one thing I wanted","Screaming but daddy I love him","I&#x27;m having his baby","No I&#x27;m not coming to my senses","Dutiful daughter all my plans were laid","Tendrils tucked into a woven braid","He was chaos he was revelry","Bedroom eyes like a remedy","Stay away from her","The saboteurs protested too much","Lord knows the words we never heard","Just screeching tires and true love","Screaming but daddy I love him","I&#x27;m having his baby","No I&#x27;m not coming to my senses","I&#x27;ll tell you something right now","I&#x27;d rather burn my whole life down","It&#x27;s mine alone to disgrace","God save the most judgmental creeps","You ain&#x27;t gotta pray for me","If all you want is gray for me","We came back when the heat died down","Went to my parents and they came around","All the wine moms are still holding out","But **** &#x27;em it&#x27;s over","Even my daddy just loves him","I&#x27;m his lady","And oh my God you should see your faces","I&#x27;ll tell you something right now","You ain&#x27;t gotta pray for me","He was chaos he was revelry","If all you want is gray for me","Screaming but daddy I love him","I&#x27;m having his baby","No I&#x27;m not but you","Should see your faces","But oh my God you should see your faces","He was chaos he was revelry"],"song":"76594"}
