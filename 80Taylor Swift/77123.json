{"name":"I Can Fix Him ","cover":"Taylor Swift","content":["The smoke cloud billows out his mouth","The jokes that he told across the bar","Were revolting and far too loud","Tell &#x27;em he&#x27;s my man","I can fix him no really I can","And only I can","The dopamine races through his brain","His hand so calloused from his pistol","Softly traces hearts on my face","And I could see it from a mile away","A perfect case for my certain skillset","He had a halo of the highest grade","He just hadn&#x27;t met me yet","Tell &#x27;em he&#x27;s my man","I can fix him no really I can","And only I can","Good boy that&#x27;s right","Come close I&#x27;ll show you heaven","If you&#x27;ll be an angel all night","No really I can","Told &#x27;em he&#x27;s my man","I told &#x27;em he&#x27;s my man","I can fix him no really I can","No really I can","Whoa maybe I can&#x27;t"],"song":"77123"}
