{"name":"Speak Now","cover":"Taylor Swift","content":["I am not the kind of girl","But you are not the kind of boy","Who should be marrying the wrong girl","I sneak in and see your friends","And she is yelling at a bridesmaid","Somewhere back inside a room","Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry","I lose myself in a daydream","Where I stand and say","Don&#x27;t say yes","Run away now","Don&#x27;t wait or say a single vow","You need to hear me out","And they said speak now","Fond gestures are exchanged","And the organ starts to play","A song that sounds like a death March","And I am hiding in the curtains","But I know you wish it was me","You wish it was me","Don&#x27;t you","Don&#x27;t say yes","Run away now","Don&#x27;t wait or say a single vow","You need to hear me out","And they said speak now","Don&#x27;t say yes","Run away now","Don&#x27;t wait or say a single vow","Your time is running out","And they said speak now","Oh la la ~Oh oh","I hear the preacher say","Speak now or forever hold your peace","But I&#x27;m only looking at you","I am not the kind of girl","But you are not the kind of boy","Who should be marrying the wrong girl","So don&#x27;t say yes","Run away now","Don&#x27;t wait or say a single vow","You need to hear me out","Speak now","And you say Let&#x27;s run away now","When they said","Speak now"],"song":"83639"}
