{"name":"Russian Roulette","cover":"Rihanna","content":["Take a breath  take it deep","Calm yourself  he says to me","If you play  you play for key","Take a gun  and count to three","I&#x27;m sweating now  moving slow","No time to think  my turn to go","And you can see my heart beating","You can see it through my chest","I know that I must must pass this test","So just pull the trigger","Say a prayer to yourself","He says close your eyes","Sometimes it helps","And then I get a scary thought","And you can see my heart beating","You can see it through my chest","Know that I must must pass this test","So just pull the trigger","As my life flashes before my eyes","And you can see my heart beating","You can see it through my chest","Know that I must must pass this test","And you can see my heart beating","You can see it through my chest","Know that I must must pass this test","So just pull the trigger"],"song":"22787"}
