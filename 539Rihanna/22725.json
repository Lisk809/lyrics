{"name":"Stay","cover":"Rihanna","content":["All along it was a fever","爱恋如同潮汐般席卷神经","我们就像甜蜜又狂热的信徒","我摊开双手悬浮在半空中 证明你所谓的爱我","他说 若你有勇气就让我们再靠近一些","情路漫漫且又波澜曲折","若定终身且勿忘告知于我","Not really sure how to feel about it","我的内心感受 难以言表","Something in the way you move","你所有的言行举止","我深陷于爱河无法自拔 不可度过无你的春秋年月","And it takes me all the way","我一路驱使着我那疲惫的灵魂","I want you to stay","唯有愿君留下","你的生活应该更加精彩","爱不仅仅局限于占有 更在于给予","情路必然峰回路转 但也必会迂回","若定终身且勿忘告知于我","Not really sure how to feel about it","我的内心感受 难以言表","Something in the way you move","你所有的言行举止","我深陷于爱河无法自拔 不可度过无你的春秋年月","And it takes me all the way","我一路驱使着我那疲惫的灵魂","And I want you to stay","唯有愿君留下","Ooh the reason I hold on","对这份执着的爱把持的原因","Ooh &#x27;cause I need this hole gone","只为填补那空洞的灵魂","Funny you&#x27;re the broken one","真可笑 你是受伤的那个人","但我却是唯一需要被拯救的","当你被蒙蔽了双眼 见不到半束曙光","则难知谁心如刀割","Not really sure how to feel about it","我的内心感受 难以言表","Something in the way you move","你所有的言行举止","我深陷于爱河无法自拔 不可度过无你的春秋年月","And it takes me all the way","我一路驱使着我那疲惫的灵魂","I want you to stay","唯有愿君留下","Stay","留下","I want you to stay","唯有愿君留下","Ooh"],"song":"22725"}
