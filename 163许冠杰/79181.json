{"name":"I Saw The Light","cover":"许冠杰","content":["It was late last night","There was not another soul in sight","Only you","So we walked along","Though I knew there was something wrong","Then you gazed up at me","And the answer was plain to see","In your eyes","Though we had our fling","I just never would suspect a thing","In my head","But I tried to run","But my feelings for you","Were just something I never knew","&#x27;Til I saw the light in your eyes","In your eyes","But I love you best","In my eyes","And I ran out before","But I won&#x27;t do it anymore","Can&#x27;t you see the light in my eyes","In my eyes","In my eyes","In my eyes","In my eyes"],"song":"79181"}
