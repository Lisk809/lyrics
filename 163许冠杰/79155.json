{"name":"Travelling Boy","cover":"许冠杰","content":["Wake up my love beneath","the middy sun alone once more alone","This travelling boy was","only passing throng","But he will always think of you","One night of love beside","a strange young smile","As warm as i have known","a travelling boy and","only passing through","But one who&#x27;ll always think of you","Take my place out on the road again","i must do what i must do","Yes i know we were loves","but a drifter discoves","That a perfect love won&#x27;t","always last forever","Cause time alone will tell","So no goodbyes for one","just passing through","But one who&#x27;ll alway think of you","Yes i know we were loves","but a drifter discoves","That a perfect love won&#x27;t","always last forever","Cause time alone will tell","So no goodbyes for one","just passing through","But one who&#x27;ll always think of you"],"song":"79155"}
