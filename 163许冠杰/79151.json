{"name":"Me And The Elephant","cover":"许冠杰","content":["I remember the day we had nothing to do","So we went down to the city zoo","Just to kill an hour or two","Out in the good sunshine","We had so much fun","We were glad that we came","Feed all the animals","And gave each a name","We had a real good time","Now that its over and your far away","I miss you more with each passin day","All my friends sympathize and say","Give yourself a little time","But it&#x27;s already been over a year","Just in case you interested","You might like to hear","How everyone is doing down","At the city zoo with out you","Well the monkey forgot you","The hippo forgot you","And so did the kangaroo","But me and the elephant","We still remember you","Would all have to go","So i burned all of your pictures","Except two or three","The one by my bed","And the one on my tv","And the one that i always carry","With me everywhere i go","And today was so nice","And since i was in town","And what&#x27;s new","Well the rhino forgot you","The zebra forgot you","The polar bear and the tiger too"],"song":"79151"}
