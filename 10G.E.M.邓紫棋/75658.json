{"name":"Amazing Grace","cover":"G.E.M.邓紫棋","content":["Amazing grace how sweet the sound","That saved a wretch like me","I once was lost but now I&#x27;m found","Was blind but now I see","And grace my fears relieved","How precious did that grace appear","The hour I first believed","Through many dangers toils and snares","We have already come","And grace will lead us home","Bright shining as the sun","Than when we first begun","I once was lost but now I&#x27;m found","Was blind but now I see"],"song":"75658"}
