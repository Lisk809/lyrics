{"name":"Rewind","cover":"Westlife","content":["It feels like forever","Since you were here right next to me","We were together","Then we just came apart at the seams","And somewhere we forgot how to dream","We let go to all that could have been","I heard that you found someone else","Who gives you so much more","But deep in my soul","Wanna know","Do you think of me at all","You and I you and I you and I","But we gave up before finishing line","We said it all but never said goodbye","You and I you and I you and I","Can we just rewind","Can we just rewind","We should never say never","Cause just like every season we changed","But deep in my soul","I wanna know","Do you think of me at all","You and I you and I you and I","But we gave up before finishing line","We said it all but never said goodbye","You and I you and I you and I","Can we just rewind","Can we just rewind","Can we just rewind","Can we just rewind","You and I you and I you and I","Can we just rewind"],"song":"39778"}
