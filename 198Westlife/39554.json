{"name":"Mandy","cover":"Westlife","content":["I remember all my life","Raining down as cold as ice","Shadows of a man","A face through a window","Crying in the night","Happy people pass my way","Looking in their eyes  i see a memory","I never realized how happy you made me","But i sent you away","And i need you today  oh mandy","I&#x27;m standing on the edge of time","Caught up in a world of uphill climbing","But i sent you away","And i need you today  oh mandy","Crying on a breeze  the pain is calling","But i sent you away","And i need you today","But i sent you away","And i need you today","But i sent you away","Oh mandy"],"song":"39554"}
