{"name":"Flying Without You","cover":"Westlife","content":["One thing that makes it all complete","Places you never knew it could be","Some find it in their lover&#x27;s eyes","Who can deny the joy it brings","You&#x27;ve found that special thing","You&#x27;re flying without wings","Some find it each and every morning","Some in their solitary lives","A simple line can make you laugh or cry","The kind you cherish all your life","And when you know how much that means","You&#x27;ve found that special thing","You&#x27;re flying without wings","So impossible as it may seem","Would have made you complete","To watch the sunrise on your face","On your face","To know that i can say i love you","In any given time or place","Those are the things that make you mine","And it&#x27;s like flying without wings","Cos you&#x27;re my special thing","I&#x27;m flying without wings","As i did","And you&#x27;ll be where it ends","I&#x27;m flying without wings","And that&#x27;s the joy you bring","I&#x27;m flying without wings"],"song":"39717"}
