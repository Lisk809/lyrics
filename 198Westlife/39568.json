{"name":"Have You Ever Been In Love","cover":"Westlife","content":["In the morning light","Half awake and half asleep","Have you ever laid there thinking","Was it all a dream","But you reach out and she&#x27;s there","Every moment&#x27; everywhere","Have you ever been in love","Have you ever felt","How far a heart can fall","Have you ever stayed up waiting","For a telephone call","Just to hear her say hello","Cause you miss each other so","Have you ever been in love","Have there been times to laugh","And times you really want to cry","Finding reasons to believe her","And when in times of doubt","Have you ever tried to work it out","But still she leaves you wondering","What it&#x27;s all about","And when she&#x27;s far away","Have you ever felt the need to stray","And tried and then discovered","It just doesn&#x27;t pay","Cause with her&#x27; you can be true","And with her&#x27; you can be you","Have you ever been in love","Have there been times to laugh","And times you really want to cry","Finding reasons to believe her","And when in times of doubt","Have you ever tried to work it out","But still she leaves you wondering","What its all about","And when the night comes down","Can you call your house a home","Do you dream you&#x27;re still together","And wake up alone","Have you ever been in love","The way that I&#x27;m in love","Have you ever been in love","Have you ever been in love"],"song":"39568"}
