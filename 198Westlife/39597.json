{"name":"To Be Loved","cover":"Westlife","content":["The song of a little bird","The joy in three little words","I know it&#x27;s real","That&#x27;s how it feels","To be loved by you","The stars from a midnight sky","The melody from a lullaby","There&#x27;s nothing real","That I wouldn&#x27;t steal","To be loved by you","To be loved by you","If everybody knows","It&#x27;s only &#x27;cause it shows","A smile to put you on a high","A kiss that sets your soul alight","Being loved by you","Being loved by you","If everybody knows","It&#x27;s only &#x27;cause it shows","Your love is released","And you move me with ease","And you rescue me time after time","Oh Oh you give your all","And you take it all in your stride","Oh with all the power of a symphony","To be loved by you","Oh yeah to be loved by you","I know what it is I need","It&#x27;s clear as a shallow stream","It&#x27;s as it seems my only dreams","To be loved by you"],"song":"39597"}
