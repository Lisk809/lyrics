{"name":"The Rose","cover":"Westlife","content":["Some say love it is a river","That drowns the tender reed","Some say love it is a razor","That leaves your soul to bleed","Some say love it is a hunger","An endless aching need","I say love it is a flower","And you it&#x27;s only seed","It&#x27;s the heart afraid of breaking","That never learns to dance","It&#x27;s the dream afraid of waking","That never takes the chance","Who cannot seem to give","And the soul afraid of dying","That never learns to live","When the night has been too lonely","And the road has been too long","And you think that love is only","For the lucky and the strong","Just remember in the winter","Far beneath the bitter snows","In the spring becomes the rose"],"song":"39561"}
