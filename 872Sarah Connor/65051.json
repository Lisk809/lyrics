{"name":"Love On A Two Way Street","cover":"Sarah Connor","content":["I found love on a two way street","And lost it on a lonely highway","Love on a two way street","And lost it on a lonely highway","True love will never die","It is finally goodbye  I know","With the music softly playing","His lips were gently saying","I love you","He held me in desperation","I thought it was a revelation","And then he walked out","How could I be so blind","To give up love the very first time","To be fooled is a hurting pain","To be loved and fooled","Is a crying shame","While I bear the blame","As he laughs my name","With the music softly playing","His lips were gently saying","He held me in desperation","I thought it was a revelation","And then he walked out","I found love on a two way street","And lost it on a lonely highway","Love on a two way street","And lost it on a lonely highway","Ooh  bye bye baby  bye bye","I lost it on a lonely highway","Bye bye baby  bye bye","I lost it on a lonely highway"],"song":"65051"}
