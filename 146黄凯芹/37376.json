{"name":"My Way ","cover":"黄凯芹","content":["And now the end is near","And so I face the final curtain","My friend I&#x27;ll say it clear","I&#x27;ve lived a life that&#x27;s full","And more much more than this","I did it my way","Regrets I&#x27;ve had a few","But then again too few to mention","I did what I had to do","And saw it through without exemption","I planned each charted course","And more much more than this","I did it my way","When I bit off more than I could chew","But through it all when there was doubt","I ate it up and spit it out","I faced it all and I stood tall","And did it my way","I&#x27;ve loved laughed and cried","And now as tears subside","I find it all so amusing","To think I did all that","And may I say not in a shy way","Oh no oh no not me","I did it my way","For what is a man what has he got","If not himself then he has naught","To say the things he truly feels","And not the words of someone who kneels","The record shows I took the blows","And did it my way","Yes it was my way"],"song":"37376"}
