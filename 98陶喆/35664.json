{"name":"One Last Cry","cover":"陶喆","content":["My shattered dreams and broken heart","Are mending on the shelf","Now I sit all alone","Wishing all my feeling was gone","I&#x27;d give my best to you","Nothing for me to do","But have one last cry","One last cry","Before I leave it all behind","Stop living a lie","I guess I&#x27;m down to one last cry","I was here you were there","Guess we never could agree","While the sun shines on you","I need some love to rain on me","Still I sit all alone","Wishing all my feeling was gone","Gotta get over you","Nothing for me to do","But have one last cry","One last cry","I have to live it all behind","Stop living a lie","I know I gotta be strong","Yeah yeah","I&#x27;m gonna dry my eyes","Right after I have my one","Have my one last cry","One last cry","Before I leave it all behind","I&#x27;m gonna put you out of my mind","Last time","Stop living a lie","I guess I&#x27;m down","I guess I&#x27;m down","I guess I&#x27;m down to one last cry"],"song":"35664"}
