{"name":"Honolulu City Lights (英语)","cover":"关淑怡","content":["Lookin&#x27; out upon the city lights","And the stars above the ocean","Got my ticket for the midnight plane","And it&#x27;s not easy to leave again","Took my clothes and put them in my bag","Lookin&#x27; out into the city night","And it&#x27;s not easy to leave again","Each time Honolulu city lights","Stir up memories in me","Each night Honolulu city lights","Bring me back again","You are my island sunset","You are my island dream","Put on my shoes and light a cigarette","It&#x27;s not easy to leave again","Each time Honolulu city lights","Stir up memories in me","Each night Honolulu city lights","Bring me back again","Bring me back again"],"song":"43629"}
