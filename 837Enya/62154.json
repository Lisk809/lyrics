{"name":"Marble Halls","cover":"Enya","content":["I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls","With vassals and serfs at my side","That I was the hope and the pride","I had riches all too great to count","And a high ancestral name  But","I also dreamt which pleased me most","That you loved me still the same","That you loved me","You loved me still the same","That you loved me","You loved me still the same","I dreamt that suitors sought my hand","That knights upon bended knee","They pledged their faith to me","Came forth my hand to claim","But I also dreamt which charmed me most","That you loved me still the same","That you loved me","You loved me still the same","That you loved me","You loved me still the same"],"song":"62154"}
