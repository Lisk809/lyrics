{"name":"Christmas Secret","cover":"Enya","content":["Underneath a winter sky","A distant train sings out the miles","And so I wonder can it be","Will every mile bring you to me","A promise made may still come true","So I am waiting here for you","If you don&#x27;t come  what will I do","Who shall I tell my secrets to","Christmas bells ring out their chimes","I hear them echo through the miles","And moonlight shines upon the road","And trembles on the fallen snow","I look into the midnight blue","So many stars I never knew","If you don&#x27;t come  what will I do","Who shall I tell my secrets to","I look into the midnight blue","So many stars I never knew","If you don&#x27;t come  what will I do","Who shall I tell my secrets to"],"song":"62218"}
