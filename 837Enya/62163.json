Time Flies!","cover":"Enya","content":["My  My  Time flies","One step and we&#x27;re on the moon","Next step into the stars","My  My  Time flies","Maybe we could be there soon","A one way ticket to mars","My  My  Time flies","A man underneath a tree","An apple falls on his head","My my time flies a man","Wrote a symphony","It&#x27;s 1812","My  My  Time flies","Four guys across abbey road","One forgot to wear shoes","My  My  Time flies","A rap on a rhapsody","A king who&#x27;s still in the news","A king to sing you the blues","My  My  Time flies","A man in a winter sleigh","White white white as the snow","My  My  Time flies","A new day is on it&#x27;s way","So let&#x27;s let yesterday go","Could be we step out again","Could be tomorrow but then","Could be 2010"],"song":"62163"}
