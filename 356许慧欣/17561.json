{"name":"My Love Will Be True","cover":"许慧欣","content":["These are my words","Praying to the stars","To become someone special to you","I&#x27;ve been waiting for so long","For you to be near","As if I breathed for the first time","As light as feather soaring up high","Bright as guiding light in my eyes","Smile as if you created my all","The moon was made out of your dreams","The ocean made out of your tears","I realize all on my own","Wondering the reason why","My heart and soul confused","Give me a chance","For the rest of my life","My love will be true","Trying hard to reach","Hanging on to promise without meaning","As if I breathed for the first time","As light as feather soaring up high","Bright as guiding light in my eyes","Smile as if you created my all","The moon was made out of your dreams","The ocean made out of your tears","I realize all on my own","Wondering the reason why","My heart and soul confused","Give me a chance","For the rest of my life","My love will be true","My love will be true","My love will be true","My love will be true","My love will be true"],"song":"17561"}
