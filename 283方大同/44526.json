{"name":"Can You Feel The Music","cover":"方大同","content":["感受这律动","这绝不是懒音乐","你得找个步子","给我招徕一个猛的鼓手","而不是一台机器","拍子里每一刻在陶醉","OH 你行不行","So tell me can you feel it","Can you feel the music","Well tell me can you feel it","Can you feel the music","把握你的TONE","就算弹一根弦","必须找到那共鸣","给我招徕一个贝斯手","最好他来自少林","看他马步站的稳不稳","OH 你行不行","So tell me can you feel it","Can you feel the music","Well tell me can you feel it","Can you feel the music","So tell me can you feel it","Can you feel the music","Well tell me can you feel it","Can you feel the music"],"song":"44526"}
