{"name":"Orange Moon","cover":"方大同","content":["There we sat among the thousand","Fools just like us","But not so in love like us","There we spoke of all our feelings","And dreams were born like that","And we hope for love like that","Leading you from my mind","I want to stand with you again","I hope to find you here again","In the eternal sunshine","I&#x27;ll search for the orange moon","That lit up our love on the ocean","While i held your hand","Now watch all the waves from the stones","Where we gazed to the golden sun","If i see the horizon","Lay your head upon my shoulder","I&#x27;ll sing a tune or three","Sweet melodies for thee","Softly speak to say what i meant","Why do you leave","My heart is at your sleeve","Practise these words with you again","If you think is possible","And maybe i can pull you close","I&#x27;ll search for the orange moon","That lit up our love on the ocean","While i held your hand","Now watch all the waves from the stones","Where we gazed to the golden sun","If i see the horizon","I&#x27;ll search for the orange moon","That lit up our love on the ocean","While i held your hand","Now watch all the waves from the stones","Where we gazed to the golden sun","If i see the horizon"],"song":"44492"}
