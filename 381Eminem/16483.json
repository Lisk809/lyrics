{"name":"Forever(Verse)","cover":"Eminem","content":["He can make them look like Bozos","F**k no go for broke","His cup just runneth over oh no","He ain&#x27;t had a real buzz like this","Since the last time that he overdosed","Back into the game and they know","Rap will never be the same as before","Bashing in the brains of these hoes","And establishing a name as he goes","The passion and the flame is ignited","This sh*t is exactly what the f**k that","I&#x27;m talking about when we riot","Flying up out of our mouths","Now rewind it","That it shakes the place","I&#x27;m through with this place","So Drake","It may not mean nothing to y&#x27;all","But understand nothing was done for me","So I don&#x27;t plan on stopping at all","I&#x27;m shutting sh*t down at the mall","And I ain&#x27;t even planning to call","I want this sh*t forever man"],"song":"16483"}
