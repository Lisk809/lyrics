{"name":"Rock Bottom","cover":"Eminem","content":["Ayo this song is dedicated","这首歌献给所有快乐的人","To all the happy people","快乐的人才有真正的幸福","All the happy people","若没有自己的想法，则终日碌碌无为","Who have real nice lives","我感觉自己像是在高空钢丝上行走","And have no idea","脚下没有保护网","What it&#x27;s like to be broke as f**k","我沉溺于药剂","我精神失落","我本应该得到尊重","但我的血汗换回的支票根本不值钱","我要失控了，我需要有人帮我解决我的债","Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged","可怜的薪水让我的肾上腺素上升","充满怨恨和愤怒","况且我还订婚了","It&#x27;s got my ass hyper","我的女儿只剩下最后一片尿布","I pray that God answers","我快要被逼疯了","Maybe I&#x27;ll ask nicer","祈祷上帝能给我答复，也许我应更虔诚","看着这些一举成名的人寻找自己的道路","一夜成名的歌星不断给别人签名","我们渴望有一天爆发，把过去忘掉","与没有实力的人和普通的无才者一起","那些善妒的小人变的畏畏缩缩","因为我们看见钱就变的盲目","钱会把我们洗脑，让我们没有主见","像没有脊柱的蛇在草丛中蠕动","That&#x27;s rock bottom","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","当这样的生活让你愤怒的想要犯罪","That&#x27;s rock bottom","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","当你的欲望只能靠偷窃来满足","That&#x27;s rock bottom","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","当你觉得水已淹过脖子","&#x27;Cause you mad enough to scream","你想大声怒吼，但你的处境让你沮丧流泪","But you sad enough to tear","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","That&#x27;s rock bottom","当这样的生活让你愤怒的想要犯罪","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","That&#x27;s rock bottom","当你的欲望只能靠偷窃来满足","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","That&#x27;s rock bottom","当你觉得水已淹过脖子","你想大声怒吼，但你的处境让你沮丧流泪","&#x27;Cause you mad enough to scream","我的生活充满空洞的承诺","But you sad enough to tear","以及破碎的梦想","我希望事情会好转","I&#x27;m hopin&#x27; things look up","却无济于事","But there ain&#x27;t no job openings","我心灰意冷，饥肠辘辘","I feel discouraged","住在没有火炉的房子里","Hungry and malnourished","我厌烦了这没有出头之路，工资极少的工作","我厌烦了在同一天被雇佣又被解雇","若你知道游戏的规则，就觉得真该死","我们死去时会有同样的结果","But f**k it","成为选手很风光，成为粉丝很糟糕","If you know the rules to the game play","你需要的是成为有钱人","&#x27;Cause when we die","配上一部豪华轿车","We know we all goin&#x27; the same way","宽敞舒适，能容下六人","他们将我置于其中","But it sucks to be the fan","和这些悲观的疯子","沮丧地四处走动","Plus a luxury sedan","吸大量的烟","Or comfortable and roomy in a 6","昨天快速离去，似乎还在眼前","我女儿想玩球，可我太累了","Who walk around depressed","生命过了一半，忘掉接下来的一切","And smoke a pound of cess a day","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","And yesterday went by so quick","当这样的生活让你愤怒的想要犯罪","It seems like it was just today","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","My daughter wants to throw the ball","当你的欲望只能靠偷窃来满足","But I&#x27;m too stressed to play","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","当你觉得水已淹过脖子","That&#x27;s rock bottom","你想大声怒吼，但你的处境让你沮丧流泪","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","That&#x27;s rock bottom","当这样的生活让你愤怒的想要犯罪","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","That&#x27;s rock bottom","当你的欲望只能靠偷窃来满足","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","&#x27;Cause you mad enough to scream","当你觉得水已淹过脖子","But you sad enough to tear","你想大声怒吼，但你的处境让你沮丧流泪","That&#x27;s rock bottom","这是爱我和讨厌我的人","但恶魔使我满口谎话，整天勾心斗角","That&#x27;s rock bottom","我想要财，色，名，运","这表示我将结束烈火焚身地狱般的生活","That&#x27;s rock bottom","这表示我偷取了你的支票，伪造了你的名字","生命中充满了永恒的折磨和痛苦","&#x27;Cause you mad enough to scream","我现在感觉我跌到了谷底","But you sad enough to tear","问题出现了，每人都在我的街区","警察射杀他们时，我发出尖叫","But it&#x27;s the evil that made me","手拿两把手枪，我希望你的门上了新锁","我女儿没有穿袜子和鞋子","手上的戒指看起来像石头","你炫耀的时候，我可以带他们去典当行","我有几个崭新的戒指和一块新的名牌手表","我从来没有一首赚钱的金曲","我在草坪上奔跑，枪声落下","I&#x27;ve got problems","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","当这样的生活让你愤怒的想要犯罪","这就是残酷的现实，生命的沟谷","Holdin&#x27; two Glocks","当你的欲望只能靠偷窃来满足"],"song":"16658"}
