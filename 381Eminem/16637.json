{"name":"Hazardous Youth","cover":"Eminem","content":["Patroling corners looking for hookers","Im meaner in action","With a f**ked up childhood","That i use as an excuse","Since the 3rd time i failed 9th grade","You probably think im a negative person","As i fall down a cement flight of steps","And land aside a bed of spider webs","So throw caution to the wind you","And a friend can jump off of a bridge","Why not blow your brain out","Once you might as well die now"],"song":"16637"}
