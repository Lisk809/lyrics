{"name":"WAWWA","cover":"白鲨JAWS","content":["WAWWA","在这安静的角落","我们轻轻把所有真心诉说","这世间难以捉摸","彼此握紧的手一点点温热","当时间一闪而过","有多少窘迫至今没有对策","可希望就像辐射","你和我终于赌上一切复活","不是冲动才爱了","不是欲望驱使着","可拥抱着你的双手不管多久总也不肯松","那就一直这样吧","有点悲伤的真话","把面具都融化","你眼中的泪花","不再害怕","Don’t you ever change who you are","成为自己的路其实一直不太好走","Even when the light seemed so far","从现在开始你不会再一个人承受","Even if you fall in the dark","快乐或者苦涩我都要牵着你的手","Light up the sky, light up the night","Just like a shooting star.","We are who we are","We are who we are","数不清多少选择","我还热泪盈眶地望着日落","真话都来得赤裸","可我真的想说有你就够了","不是冲动才爱了","不是欲望驱使着","可拥抱着你的双手不管多久总也不肯松","那就一直这样吧","有点悲伤的真话","把面具都融化","你眼中的泪花","已经回答","Don’t you ever change who you are","成为自己的路其实一直不太好走","Even when the light seemed so far","从现在开始你不会再一个人承受","Even if you fall in the dark","快乐或者苦涩我都要牵着你的手","Light up the sky, light up the night","Just like a shooting star.","We are who we are","We are who we are","We are who we are","We are who we are","Don’t you ever change who you are","成为自己的路其实一直不太好走","Even when the light seemed so far","从现在开始你不会再一个人承受","Even if you fall in the dark","快乐或者苦涩我都要牵着你的手","Light up the sky, light up the night","Just like a shooting star.","We are who we are","We are who we are"],"song":"67984"}
