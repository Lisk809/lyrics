{"name":"A Letter","cover":"白鲨JAWS","content":["It&#x27;s been a while now","Since I could raise a pen","And feel my heart beating","I woke up from this poison","To see the world instead","I had lost you in it","When I sewed my eyes and reached","Replaying my memories","They hurt my finger tips","Chasing away ghosts","So that when I&#x27;m alone","I could stick my fall","I know when time goes","It will hang the phone","Before the sun sets low","But I wouldn&#x27;t leave at all","Right here I found my soul","But there&#x27;s no way to","Turn off this feeling","I don&#x27;t deserve to","Get caught in between","Some day I should be reacquainted","With your reality without my shadow","Haunting me","The colors I see","Are never meant to paint","Withering roses","But why would I explain","Myself again to another sunrise","Without the moonlight by my side","Laughing at my own jokes","Will it soft the blow","For when I let you go","At my own one man show","I never had to know","That it wasn&#x27;t real at all","Leading different roles","Waiting by the door","I hesitated","But pain will fade","Oh there&#x27;s no way to","Turn off this feeling","I don&#x27;t deserve to","Get caught in between","Some day I should be reacquainted","With your reality","I&#x27;m spiraling down for now","Just let me be","Turn off this feeling","I don&#x27;t deserve to","Get caught in between","Some day I should be reacquainted","With your reality without my shadow","Haunting me someone will tell me","The colors I see","Are never meant to paint","Withering roses","But why would I explain","Myself again to another sunrise","Without the moonlight by my side"],"song":"67997"}
