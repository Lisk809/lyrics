{"name":"I’m Yours","cover":"The Script","content":["Lrc by lzh  from jiangxi pingxiang","You touch these tired eyes of mine","你抚摸我疲倦的双眼","And map my face out line by line","整理好的脸庞","And somehow growing old feels fine","不知为何，岁月增长感觉如此美好","静静听，因为我并不聪明","You wrap your thoughts in works of art","你用想法包裹着艺术品","它们就挂在我心墙上","I may not have the softest touch;","或许我的抚摸不是最温柔的","I may not say the words as such","也许我说的话，并不那么像是，属于你","尽管我看起来，也不那么像是，属于你","And though my edges may be rough;","或许我的棱角太过锋利","I never feel i&#x27;m quite enough;","我永不觉得足够","尽管看起来不那么像，但，我属于你","时间流逝，你将伤口治愈","Embraced my soul  you loved my mind","拥抱我的灵魂，你爱我的真心","You&#x27;re the only angel in my life","你是我一生中唯一的天使","The day news came my best friend died","消息传来，我最好的朋友逝世","My knees went weak; you saw me cry","我摇摇欲坠，你看着我哭泣","你说，我，你眼中的骑士，还在这里","I may not have the softest touch;","或许我的抚摸不是最温柔的","I may not say the words as such","也许我说的话，并不那么像是，属于你","尽管我看起来，也不那么像是，属于你","And though my edges may be rough;","或许我的棱角太过锋利","I never feel i&#x27;m quite enough;","我永不觉得足够","尽管看起来不那么像，但，我属于你","I may not have the softest touch;","或许我的抚摸不是最温柔的","I may not say the words as such","也许我说的话，并不那么像是，属于你","我知道我并不那么合适，但，我属于你"],"song":"61034"}
