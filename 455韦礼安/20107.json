{"name":"This Love","cover":"韦礼安","content":["I was so high I did not recognize","The fire burning in her eyes","The chaos that controlled my mind","Never to return again","But always in my heart","This love has taken it’s toll on me","She said goodbye too many times before","I tried my best to feed her appetite","Keep her coming every night","So hard to keep her satisfied","Pretending to feel the same","Then turn around and leave again","This love has taken it’s toll on me","She said goodbye too many times before","I’ll fix these broken things","Repair your broken wings","And make sure everything’s alright","My pressure on her hips","Sinking my fingertips","Into every inch of you","This love has taken it’s toll on me","She said goodbye too many times before","This love has taken it’s toll on me","She said goodbye too many times before"],"song":"20107"}
