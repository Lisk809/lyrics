{"name":"Read My Mind","cover":"Olly Murs","content":["Late night calling","But it&#x27;s better if we walk away","So we only have one drink left","Baby if you wanna stay the night","Getting down until we blow the lights","Put your body next to mine","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","Baby I ain&#x27;t got no self control","Put your body next to mine","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","Daylight is falling","Baby I still feel it in the air","Close those curtains","Play another game of truth or dare","So I guess we should have walked away","Cause you know what brings us into pain","Baby if you wanna stay the night","Getting down until we blow the lights","Put your body next to mine","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","Baby I ain&#x27;t got no self control","With your body next to mine","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","Late night calling","Time fast foward","Baby if you wanna stay the night","Getting down until we blow the lights","Put your body next to mine","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","Baby I ain&#x27;t got no self control","With your body next to mine","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind","You don&#x27;t have to read my mind"],"song":"10387"}
