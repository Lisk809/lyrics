{"name":"Wrecking Ball","cover":"Miley Cyrus","content":["We clawed we chained our hearts in vain","我们曾经心心相印，如今热恋已烟消云散","We jumped never asking why","我们曾经不假思索，共同坠入爱河","We kissed I fell under your spell","我们曾经热吻过，我被你的爱情魔咒所蛊惑","A love no one could deny","我们的爱情，无人能够否认","千万不要说我轻易离开","I will always want you","我会一直思念着你","我无法忍受生命中的谎言","I will always want you","我会一直思念着你","I came in like a wrecking ball","我正如落锤般坠下","I never hit so hard in love","从未经历过如此决绝的爱情","All I wanted was to break your walls","我只想打破你树立的隔阂","All you ever did was wreck me","你所做的一切不过是将我击垮","Yeah you wreck me","是的，你摧毁了我","我曾经将你捧上天空","I put you high up in the sky","而你却不再归来","And now you&#x27;re not coming down","久而久之，你让我燃烧","It slowly turned you let me burn","如今，我们已化为地上的灰烬","And now we&#x27;re ashes on the ground","千万不要说我轻易离开","我会一直思念着你","I will always want you","我无法忍受生命中的谎言","我会一直思念着你","我正如落锤般坠下","I will always want you","I came in like a wrecking ball","从未经历过如此决绝的爱情","I never hit so hard in love","我只想打破你树立的隔阂","All I wanted was to break your walls","你所做的一切不过是将我击垮","All you ever did was wreck me","我正如落锤般坠下","I came in like a wrecking ball","是的，闭上双眼尽力摇荡","Yeah I just closed my eyes and swung","蜷成一团，如火球般跌落","Left me crouching in a blaze and fall","你所做的一切不过是将我击垮","All you ever did was wreck me","是的，你摧毁了我","Yeah you wreck me","我从未想过发起两人间的战争","I never meant to start a war","只不过是想谋求你的包容","I just wanted you to let me in","而非不择手段","And instead of using force","或许，本应该让我来宽恕你","I guess I should&#x27;ve let you in","我从未想过发起两人间的战争","I never meant to start a war","只不过是想谋求你的包容","I just wanted you to let me in","或许，本应该让我来宽恕你","I guess I should&#x27;ve let you in","千万不要说我轻易离开","我会一直思念着你","I will always want you","我正如落锤般坠下","I came in like a wrecking ball","从未经历过如此决绝的爱情","I never hit so hard in love","我只想打破你树立的隔阂","All I wanted was to break your walls","你所做的一切不过是将我击垮","All you ever did was wreck me","我正如落锤般坠下","I came in like a wrecking ball","是的，闭上双眼尽力摇荡","Yeah I just closed my eyes and swung","蜷成一团，如火球般跌落","Left me crouching in a blaze and fall","你所做的一切不过是将我击垮","All you ever did was wreck me","是的，你摧毁了我","Yeah you wreck me","是的，你摧毁了我"],"song":"26320"}
