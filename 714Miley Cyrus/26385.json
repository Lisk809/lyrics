{"name":"Before The Storm â€“ duet with Jonas Brothers","cover":"Miley Cyrus","content":["I know this isn&#x27;t what I wanted","Never thought it&#x27;d come this far","Just thinking back to where we started","And how we lost all that we are","We were young and times were easy","But I could see it&#x27;s not the same","I&#x27;d give it all for that to change","And I don&#x27;t want to lose her","I don&#x27;t want to let her go","I&#x27;m standing out in the rain","I need to know if it&#x27;s over","Cause I will leave you alone","Flooded with all this pain","Knowing that I&#x27;ll never hold her","Like I did before the storm","Before the storm","With every strike of lightning","Comes a memory that lasts","And not a word is left unspoken","As the thunder starts to crash","And maybe I should give up","Standing out in the rain","I need to know if it&#x27;s over","Cause I will leave you alone","Flooded with all this pain","Knowing that I&#x27;ll never hold her","Like I did before the storm","Trying to keep the light from going out","They always say a heart is not home","Without the one","Who gets you through the storm","Standing out in the rain","Flooded with all this pain","Knowing that I&#x27;ll never hold you","Like I did before the storm","Yeah","Like I did before the storm"],"song":"26385"}
