{"name":"More to Lose","cover":"Miley Cyrus","content":["The more I stay the less I go","Stumbled down the same road before","A movie star in a worn out coat","Yeah throw away my mind","It happens all the time","I stay when the ecstasy is far away","And you say it","But I wish it wasn&#x27;t true","I just thought we had more to lose","The TV&#x27;s on but I don&#x27;t know","Tonight","Memories fade like denim jeans","You&#x27;re looking like","A movie star in a worn out coat","So I throwaway my mind","It happens all the time","Oh I stay when the ecstasy is far away","And you say it","But I wish it wasn&#x27;t true","I just thought we had more to lose","Yeah you&#x27;re looking like","A movie star in a worn out coat","So I throw away my mind","It happens all the time","God it happens all the time","I stay when the ecstasy is far away","But it don&#x27;t pay","And you say it","But I wish it wasn&#x27;t true","I just thought we had more to lose"],"song":"90604"}
