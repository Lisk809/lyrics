{"name":"Everytime You Run","cover":"Manafest","content":["Last night got a little crazy","My friends say I was tweaked out&#x27;","Every time you run","I keep hearing from the landlord pay up","Hung over and I havent seen a pay check","I took a job downtown at the factory","I was hired and fired with no salary","I keep running from responsibility","Stand up and get out of this crowd","Sure thought about the meaning of life","Joy of the lord raising up a soldier"],"song":"70050"}
