{"name":"Heart Attack","cover":"Manafest","content":["Speed ahead put a nail in my coffin","Resurrect and see a dead man walking","Sweet Jesus  so tired of running","Wake up","We&#x27;re moving way to fast","It&#x27;s hard to see the ground","My eyes flicker in a mirror of anger","Hanging on by a thread for an answer","Rain drops fall hark to your mercy","Wake up","We&#x27;re moving way to fast","It&#x27;s hard to see the ground","I&#x27;m done with playing with fire","Fed up with playing the liar","Save me from this heart attack","I feel my heart beat slowing down","Clocks ticking time is running out","There&#x27;s still a spark alive in me","I&#x27;m not ready to leave","Wake up","We&#x27;re moving way to fast","It&#x27;s hard to see the ground","I&#x27;m done with playing with fire","Fed up with playing the liar","Save me from this heart attack","Save me from this heart attack","Save me from this heart attack","Save me from this heart attack"],"song":"70006"}
