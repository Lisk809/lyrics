{"name":"Cleaninâ€™ Out My Closet","cover":"Manafest","content":["You put a lie into my head","And a war inside my heart","Try to push me off the ledge","Wanna see me fall apart","Offer me the world thinking","You&#x27;re the one in charge","But I know that you&#x27;re the devil","Only wishing you were God","Kidnapped and held for ransom","My thoughts behind the bars","Nightmares inside this mansion","I wanna make it stop","Get out of my head","Get out of my head","If the dawns after the darkness","I&#x27;m cleaning out my closet","Get out of my head","One step two step","Put me to the test","Got me hanging by thread","Try to leave me for dead","One lie two lie","Smell it on your breath","It&#x27;s the poison in my cup","Now you&#x27;ve got me seeing red","Jail break I&#x27;m not your captive","This time you&#x27;ve gone too far","My soul you thought you had it","It&#x27;s time to go to war","Get out of my head","Get out of my head","If the dawns after the darkness","I&#x27;m cleaning out my closet","Your lies have got me nauseous","Lately I&#x27;m feeling exhausted","If the dawns after the darkness","I&#x27;m cleaning out my closet","Get out","Get out","Get out of my head my head my head","Get out of my head my head","Get out of my head my head my head","Get out of my head","Get out of my head","If the dawns after the darkness","I&#x27;m cleaning out my closet","Get out of my head","Get out of my head","Get out of my head","Get out of my head","Get out of my head"],"song":"70085"}
