{"name":"Bring the Ruckus","cover":"Manafest","content":["I＇m going out with a crash","Tear it up with my past","You want to see me burn,","but burning up your barns and vermin","I＇m doing cartwheels and aerials","Get out my way before I bury you","You can try but you won＇t take me down","I＇m standing on my ground","As all the fear inside me fades away","You can try to get a reaction","But you＇re no distraction to me","This ain＇t the first or the last","If you want it, come and get it","You can＇t walk my path","I＇m burning wholes in you, better run","When you gonna learn","Loaded weapons unloading on you","With every word","Shake you down into a misery, history","Forever my time, all stars shine.","You can try but you won＇t take me down","I＇m standing on my ground","As all the fear inside me fades away","You can try to get a reaction","But you＇re no distraction to me","Bring the ruckus to me!","Bring it on I will be your enemy","Bring it on I will be your enemy","Bring it on I will be your enemy","Bring it on I will be your enemy","You can try but you won＇t take me down","I＇m standing on my ground","As all the fear inside me fades away","You can try to get a reaction","But you＇re no distraction to me","Bring the ruckus to me!"],"song":"70000"}
