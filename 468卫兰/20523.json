{"name":"In Love Again","cover":"卫兰","content":["When you smile my life becomes a","Ray of light sing me a lullaby to sleep","Spend the night","Take me to far away","Away to your secret place","Take my tears my fears","Someday with a kiss and say","When the stars don&#x27;t shine","And when the birds don&#x27;t fly","And when the flowers cry","And when the rain runs dry","When the violet&#x27;s red and when","The rose turn blue baby","I&#x27;ll still be in love with you","Take me to far away","Away to your secret place","Take my tears my fears","Someday with a kiss and say","Take me to far away","Away to your secret place","Take my tears my fears","Someday with a kiss and say"],"song":"20523"}
