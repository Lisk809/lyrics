{"name":"You’ll Never Know","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["Take a look around this lonely place","环视这个荒凉之地","Where a mask is worn on every face","每个人的脸上都戴着面具","And painted lips gently kiss","涂着厚厚的唇彩 缓慢地抽着","The end of their cigarettes","他们手中的雪茄","This world is dressed in such finess","整个世界都蒙上一片灰尘","To cover all the emptiness","想要掩盖所有的空虚","We&#x27;re standing here in between","我们站在这里","The pages of a magazine","杂志的页面上写着","你永远都不会知道我内心的感受","我也永远都不会明白你心中的想法","Until we share what we keep in private","除非我们与他人分享心中的秘密","除非我们寻找到人生缺少的东西","Our shadows move across the wall","才能忘记那些阴影 越过心中的障碍","No promises no talk at all","没有什么承诺 也毫无交谈","Inside the crowd we dance alone","我们在人群中独自舞蹈着","With faces made of stone","面对着那些冷冰冰的面孔","你永远都不会知道我内心的感受","我也永远都不会明白你心中的想法","Untill we share what we keep in private","除非我们与他人分享心中的秘密","除非我们寻找到人生缺少的东西","你永远都不会知道我内心的感受","我也永远都不会明白你心中的想法","Until we share what we keep in private","除非我们与他人分享心中的秘密","除非我们寻找到人生缺少的东西","你永远都不会知道我内心的感受","我也永远都不会明白你心中的想法","Untill we share what we keep in private","除非我们与他人分享心中的秘密","除非我们寻找到人生缺少的东西","你永远都不会知道我内心的感受","我也永远都不会明白你心中的想法","Untill we share what we keep in private","除非我们与他人分享心中的秘密","除非我们寻找到人生缺少的东西","你永远都不会知道我内心的感受","我也永远都不会明白你心中的想法","Untill we share what we keep in private","除非我们与他人分享心中的秘密"],"song":"13562"}
