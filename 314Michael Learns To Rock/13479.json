{"name":"Hiding Away From Life","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["I am not cry myself","I look like somebody else in the mirror","There on the wall","Nothing in common with person at all","And soft the birds","Maybe I&#x27;m just a dreamer","Hiding away from life","Maybe we are just pretending","It never cuts like a knife","You are one step ahead","Like when we first met","Nothing is true off","What I said to you","Maybe I&#x27;m just a dreamer","Hiding away from life","Maybe we are just pretending","It never cuts like a knife","Just playing around with words","And that they would mean to us","Just trying to find myself again","Maybe I am just a dreamer","Hiding away from life","Maybe we are just pretending","It never cuts like a knife"],"song":"13479"}
