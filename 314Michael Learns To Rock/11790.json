{"name":"More Than a Friend","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["You got me counting the seconds","It happens every time","I&#x27;m waiting for the moment","We can sit down and talk for a while","And every time that you&#x27;re near me","My heart is running away","I wanna know that love will surround us","I&#x27;ll give anything to hear you say","That I&#x27;m more than a friend","I&#x27;m gonna try in the future","Not to live in the past","I guess that I was a dreamer","If I thought it could ever last","But every time that I see you","You bring me out in the sun","How can I hide it when we are together","I wanna know that love will surround us","I&#x27;ll give anything to hear you say","That I&#x27;m more than a friend","I wanna make you see","Everything you are to me","Try to understand","I wonder if you can","The love I have for you","Will always be true","I wanna know that love will surround us","I&#x27;ll give anything to hear you say","I wanna know that love will surround us","I&#x27;ll give anything to hear you say","That I&#x27;m more than a friend"],"song":"11790"}
