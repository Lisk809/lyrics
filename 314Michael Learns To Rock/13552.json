{"name":"Breaking My Heart","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["躺在地板上 一分一分地数着时间","Not want to break the silence","不想打破这沉默","凝视这夜晚 一切都很孤单 但那是无所谓的","那是心里的感觉 而我不喜欢","There&#x27;s no excuse my friend","没有借口 我的朋友","再一次地伤害了我的心","This is where our journey ends","我们的旅程就到此为止了","Your breaking my heart again","你又一次伤害了我的心","躺在你的床上 我细数着你说过的话","They linger in the shadows","它们还逗留在暗影里","深夜里回到家 又喝醉酒了 但是那无所谓了","我不喜欢的是你的眼神","There&#x27;s no excuse my friend","没有借口 我的朋友","再一次地伤害了我的心","This is where our journey ends","我们的旅程就到此为止了","Your breaking my heart again","你又一次伤害了我的心","There&#x27;s no excuse my friend","没有借口 我的朋友","再一次地伤害了我的心","This is where our journey ends","我们的旅程就到此为止了","Your breaking my heart again","你又一次伤害了我的心"],"song":"13552"}
