{"name":"You Took My Heart Away","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["Staring at the moon so blue","Turning all my thoughts to you","I was without hope or dream","Try to dull an inner scream","But you saw me through","Walking on a path of air","See your faces everywhere","As you melt this heart of stone","You took my heart away","When my whole world was grey","And when it&#x27;s cold at night","And you sleep by my side","You become the meaning of my life","Living in a world so cold","You were there to warm my soul","You came to mend a broken heart","You gave my life a brand new start","And now I&#x27;m in love","You took my heart away","When my whole world was grey","And when it&#x27;s cold at night","And you sleep by my side","You become the meaning of my life","Holding your hands","I won&#x27;t fear tomorrow","Here where we stand","We never be alone","You took my heart away","When my whole world was grey","And when it&#x27;s cold at night","And you sleep by my side","You become the meaning of my life","You become the meaning of my life","You become the meaning","You become the meaning of my life"],"song":"11798"}
