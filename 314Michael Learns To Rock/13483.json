{"name":"Stranger In My Heart","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["Were life has been OK","Mostly everyday","In a little corner of the world","Since long and gone","I knew I should have told you","There is a stranger in my heart","Tearing all support","Calling through the skies above","And it feels like love","My suitcase in the hall","Skies me on and on","And you are not the only one to cry","I&#x27;m sorry now","We didn&#x27;t make it","There is a stranger in my heart","Tearing all support","Calling through the skies above","And it feels like love","There is a stranger in my heart","Telling me to leave","And I know the way to go","In love I must believe","Since long and gone","I knew I should have told you","There is a stranger in my heart","Tearing all support","Calling through the skies above","And it feels like love","There is a stranger in my heart","Telling me to leave","And I know the way to go","In love I must believe"],"song":"13483"}
