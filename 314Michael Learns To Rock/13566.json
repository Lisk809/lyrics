{"name":"Time for Changes","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["You＇ve been given up and moving on","Been a runaway for far too long","What＇s the use in you crying tough","When you are longing for love","I can offer you company","Tender loving and harmony","I＇ll give you everything inside","If you would give me a try","This is time  a time for changes","Anybody＇s fool can see","This is a day  a day for you and me","Anytime you are ready","Hold the line I＇m gonna run to you","Anytime it could happen","And make this dream come true","We can let the sun come in shining in","We can make a new life begin","I＇m living for you can＇t you see","So take a chance on me","This is time  a time for changes","Anybody＇s fool can see","This is a day  a day for you and me","Anytime you are ready","Hold the line I＇m gonna run to you","Anytime it could happen","And make this dream come true","Anytime you are ready","Hold the line I＇m gonna run to you","Anytime it could happen","And make this dream come true"],"song":"13566"}
