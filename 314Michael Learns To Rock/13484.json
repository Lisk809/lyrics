{"name":"Unconcerned","cover":"Michael Learns To Rock","content":["Let me see the wind in your head","Let me hold you near","Cause today the ocean is blue","And the world is new","We know that breaches will burn","We know that tables will turn","Oh but today we are unconcerned","Let your finger touch my face","As a gift of grace","Lay your head down in the grass","Let our troubles past","We know that breaches will burn","And there are so much to learn","Oh but today we are unconcerned","Is it apart of life","The good and the bad must fight","Will there be someone hear","In the thousand years","We know that breaches will burn","We know that tables will turn","Oh but today we are unconcerned","When the city getting was strumming","And when closer for better is coming","Trying to forget our feels","Only get you&#x27;re the near","In the city army is drumming","We can hear the promises coming","Listen to our worry burn","The dream give it and love","When the city getting was strumming","And when closer for better is coming","Trying to forget our feels","Only get you&#x27;re the near","In the city army is drumming","We can hear the promises coming","Listen to our worry burn","The dream give it and love","When the city getting was strumming","And when closer for better is coming","Trying to forget our feels","Only get you&#x27;re the near"],"song":"13484"}
