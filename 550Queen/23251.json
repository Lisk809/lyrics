{"name":"Death On Two Legs","cover":"Queen","content":["Words and music by freddie mercury","You suck my blood like a leech","You break the law and you preach","Screw my brain till it hurts","You&#x27;ve taken all my money","And you want more","With your narrow minded cronies","Who are fools of the first division","Death on two legs","You&#x27;re tearing me apart","Death on two legs","Kill joy bad guy big talking small fry","You&#x27;re just an old barrow boy","Have you found a new toy to replace me","Can you face me","But now you can kiss my ass goodbye","Feel good are you satisfied","Do you feel like suicide","Is your conscience all right","Does it plague you at night","Do you feel good feel good","You talk like a big business tycoon","You&#x27;re just a hot air balloon","So no one gives you a damn","You&#x27;re just an overgrown schoolboy","Let me tan your hide","A dog with disease","Put your money where your mouth is","Was the fin on your back","Death on two legs","You&#x27;re tearing me apart","Death on two legs","Insane you should be put inside","Should be made unemployed","Then make yourself null and void","Make me feel good i feel good"],"song":"23251"}
