{"name":"Just Friends","cover":"Gavin Degraw","content":["I saw you there last night","Standing in the dark","You were acting so in love","With your hand upon his heart","But you were just friends","At least that&#x27;s what you said","If you say that I&#x27;m the one","I&#x27;ve had other options too","But all I want is you","Girl your body fits me like a glove","And you showered me with words of love","While you were just friends","At least that&#x27;s what you said","If you say that I&#x27;m the one","Why weren&#x27;t you true","You know I I trusted you","When you were just friends","At least that&#x27;s what you said","If you say that I&#x27;m the one","You were just friends","If you say that I&#x27;m the one","If you say that I&#x27;m the one","If you say that I&#x27;m the one","I&#x27;ll forgive you"],"song":"68112"}
