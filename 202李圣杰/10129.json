{"name":"For The First Time","cover":"李圣杰","content":["Are those your eyes is that your smile","I&#x27;ve been looking at you forever","But I never saw you before","Are these your hands holdin&#x27; mine","I can&#x27;t believe how much I see","When you&#x27;re looking back at me","Now I understand why love is","Love is for the first time","Can this be real can this be true","Am I the person I was this morning","And are you the same you","It&#x27;s all so strange how can it be","I can&#x27;t believe how much I see","When you&#x27;re looking back at me","Now I understand why love is","Love is for the first time","Such a long time ago","But you live with me now","Yes I&#x27;ve found you some how","And I&#x27;ve never been so sure","Can&#x27;t believe how much I see","When you&#x27;re looking back at me","Now I understand why love is","Love is for the first time"],"song":"10129"}
