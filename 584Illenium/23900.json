{"name":"Drop Our Heartsï¼Œ Pt. 2","cover":"Illenium","content":["Every time we fall","We try and breathe","In our loss","But this time you let my heart drop","Now I know I have to fight","All alone","I have to learn","To fight without you","I don&#x27;t want to let you go","It&#x27;s too hard","When we&#x27;re apart","And my heart","Can&#x27;t let you out","But such is life","I have to learn","To fight without you","Drop our hearts","Drop our hearts","Sometimes this place","Every that we was home","Tore us apart","And we did","Let it drop our hearts","But I know that the pain","Lasts just A moment","It&#x27;s just A breath","That fades away","Let&#x27;s let it go","And feel the truth","That can lead us on","Through the stars","And to the sun","Forget the pain","It lasts one little moment","It&#x27;s just A breath","That fades away","Drop our hearts","Drop our hearts","Drop our hearts","Drop our hearts","Drop our hearts"],"song":"23900"}
