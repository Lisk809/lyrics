{"name":"The Rose","cover":"林忆莲","content":["Some say love","It is a river","That drowns tender reed","Some say love","It is a razor","That leaves your soul to bleed","Some say love","It is a hunger","That endless aching need","I say love","It is a flower","And you it&#x27;s only seed","It&#x27;s the heart afriad of breaking","That never learns to dance","It&#x27;s the dream afriad of waking","That never takes the chance","Who can not seem to give","And the soul afraid of dying","That never learns to live","When the night has been too lonely","And the road has been too long","And you think","Just remember in the winter","Far beneath the bitter snow","Lies the seed","That with the sun&#x27;s love","In the spring b es the rose"],"song":"54073"}
