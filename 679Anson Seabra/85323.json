{"name":"Emerald Eyes","cover":"Anson Seabra","content":["The summer night the fading light","The perfect place the perfect time","A starry drive in mid july","Park the car turn off the lights","The birds they sang a melody","My heart was keeping time","Slow at first but still it seems","That we&#x27;ll go down in history","I&#x27;ve spent a thousand nights","Lost in your emerald eyes","Make me lose track of time","You and your emerald eyes","A subtle breeze it&#x27;s you and me","Chest to chest no in between","Anything and everything","That I could ever want and need","The birds they sang a melody","My heart was keeping time","Slow at first but still it seems","That we&#x27;ll go down in history","Lost in your emerald eyes","Make me lose track of time","You and your emerald eyes","Mmm mmm","Mmm mmm","I&#x27;ve spent a thousand nights","Lost in your emerald eyes","Make me lose track of time","You and your emerald eyes"],"song":"85323"}
