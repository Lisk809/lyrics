{"name":"Christmas List","cover":"Anson Seabra","content":["There&#x27;s an angel in the snow","She&#x27;s knocking at my door","And there&#x27;s a table set for two","A cozy little room","A window with a view of white","Then you ask me what I want this year","Well I already know","I tried to make my Christmas list","But I don&#x27;t want a single gift","So I won&#x27;t ask for anything","No shiny toys or fancy things","With you here next to me","There&#x27;s a sleigh up in the sky","With presents piled high","But none of them are mine tonight","It&#x27;s perfect on its own","And I just wanna hold it tight","&#x27;Cause you already know","I tried to make my Christmas list","But I don&#x27;t want a single gift","So I won&#x27;t ask for anything","No shiny toys or fancy things","I could lie and say I want a sweater","A holiday to warmer weather","But that&#x27;s just not the truth","Make a gift for me that&#x27;s better","Than this night with you","I don&#x27;t want something new","I just want you","I tried to make my Christmas list","But I don&#x27;t want a single gift","So I won&#x27;t ask for anything","No shiny toys or fancy things","With you here next to me"],"song":"72957"}
