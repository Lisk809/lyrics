{"name":"Heartbeat(Tainai Kaiki II)","cover":"坂本龍一","content":["And I&#x27;m drowning in its sea","Falling at its feet","Listen to my heartbeat baby","And the blood sail leaves tonight","Fated in its blindness","And the darkness sleeps","Cushioning the heartbeat","And I killed the captain sank the fleet","To liberate the heartbeat baby","And it sounds so sweet","And it sounds so sweet","Listen to our hearts beat","And the darkness sleeps","Cushioning the heartbeat","And I&#x27;m drowning in its sea","Falling at its feet","Listen to my heartbeat baby","It speaks to ghosts and souls alike","Wrapped in the blood sail","Bathed in snow","Fed on the bible grown from trees","A home in the silence safe from sound","Tainai kaiki","It won&#x27;t be long","Tainai kaiki","Won&#x27;t be long","Tainai kaiki","Won&#x27;t be long","Tainai kaiki","Won&#x27;t be long","It speaks to ghosts and souls alike","Wrapped in the blood sail","Bathed in snow","It sounds so sweet listen to my heart"],"song":"65833"}
