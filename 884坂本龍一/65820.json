{"name":"Pounding At My Heart","cover":"坂本龍一","content":["And you say you can&#x27;t love me","And I want you forever in my life","And I know that its seems strange","And I know its a surprise","And I know that you were never thinking","That I would be your guy","And I know that we&#x27;re just friend","And I know it&#x27;s hard to tell","Cause I know you oh so well","And I know you feel it too","And I see it in your eyes","And I know your spirit cries","Something I can&#x27;t say","Tearing me apart","Something I can&#x27;t name","Pounding at my heart","And I don&#x27;t want this to change","And I don&#x27;t want this to end","And I don&#x27;t want to be enemies but","I don&#x27;t want to be just friend","And this feeling that I get","It is one felt from the start","And it&#x27;s pounding at my heart","Pounding at my heart","Pounding at my heart","Concurring my world","Tearing me apart","I don&#x27;t know what to do","And I don&#x27;t think I should try","I don&#x27;t see a reason why","And all I want to know is","Are you ever gonna change in your mind","Cause I don&#x27;t like to play games","I don&#x27;t even have the time"],"song":"65820"}
