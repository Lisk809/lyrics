{"name":"You’re Beautiful","cover":"田馥甄","content":["My life is brilliant","My life is brilliant","My love is pure","I saw an angel","Of that I&#x27;m sure","She smiled at me on the subway","She was with another man","But I won&#x27;t lose no sleep on that","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;ve got a plan","You&#x27;re beautiful it&#x27;s true","I saw your face in a crowded place","And I don&#x27;t know what to do","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;ll never be with you","Yeah she caught my eye","As we walked on by","She could see from my face that I was","Flying high","You&#x27;re beautiful it&#x27;s true","I saw your face in a crowded place","And I don&#x27;t know what to do","&#x27;Cause I&#x27;ll never be with you","You&#x27;re beautiful it&#x27;s true","But it&#x27;s time to face the truth","I will never be with you"],"song":"20730"}
