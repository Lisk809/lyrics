{"name":"Would You Ever Walk Away","cover":"刘小慧","content":["From this moment I will follow you","To the borders of my country","Will you make those promises come true","Will you always want to hold me","Would you ever walk away from love","Will your lips speak what is true","If you say this is where you belong","That&#x27;s all I want from you","In the garden of my deepest soul","Is the seed to bring the future","And the student is the teacher","Would you ever walk away from love","Will your lips speak what is true","If you say this is where you belong","That&#x27;s all I want from you","Wind and rain can never","Change what is to be","Lightning strikes across","My heart so suddenly","That&#x27;s all I want from you","Would you ever walk away from love","Will your lips speak what is true","If you say this is where you belong","That&#x27;s all I want","That&#x27;s all I want from you"],"song":"10436"}
