{"name":"幸运日","cover":"萨顶顶","content":["It&#x27;s cold outside","And snowflakes dance like fireflies","And on it I can read my name","And a short","Message","To live outside of time is to be free","Have a nice day","Traffic is heavy","And rain has fallen on the city","To one side of me I hear a voice","It is a man without a face","And he has a book","Seventeen people","And the clock has stopped at nine","On the elevator wall is written","Only love can set you free","This is your lucky day","And so I say to myself","Maybe this is the moment","Maybe this is what it means to be free","Time itself is frozen","Somewhere a telephone is ringing","Is that for me","Can that be for me","There is a voice there","Could have been a dream or at least","Another place another time","Perhaps we can rendezvous","Put a name to a face","Or a face to a name","Only by leaving can you truly arrive","HAVE A NICE DAY","And so I say to myself","Maybe this is the moment","Maybe this will be my lucky day","It&#x27;s cold outside","And snowflakes dance like fireflies"],"song":"42415"}
