{"name":"Valentine’s Day","cover":"Linkin Park","content":["My insides all turn to ash so slow","我的心瞬间化为灰烬，慢慢地","And blew away as I collapsed so cold","随着我倒下而随风飘散，刺骨的寒冷","A black wind took them away from sight","我看见黑色的冬季已经离去","黑暗随即降临，那个夜晚","And the clouds above moved closer","天空的云朵离我如此之近","Looking so dissatisfied","那么阴郁","狂风一个劲不断的刮","我总是会保护好自己，但这次不会","因为我已经失去方向，不知何故","A black wind took you away from sight","我看见黑色的冬季远远暗示","黑暗随即降临，那个夜晚","And the clouds above moved closer","天空的云朵离我如此之近","Looking so dissatisfied","那么阴郁","And the ground below grew colder","地下越来越冰冷","As they put you down inside","当他们把你埋葬之后","狂风一个劲不断的刮","So now you&#x27;re gone","你走之后","And I was wrong","我完全崩溃","I never knew what it was like","我永远不知道那意味着什么","To be alone","孤单的","哦，情人节，哦，情人节","哦，情人节，哦，情人节","哦，情人节，哦，情人节","哦，情人节，哦，情人节","哦，情人节，哦，情人节","哦，情人节，哦，情人节","哦"],"song":"14388"}
