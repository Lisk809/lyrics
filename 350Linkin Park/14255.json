{"name":"Lost In The Echo","cover":"Linkin Park","content":["You were that foundation","Never gonna be another one  no","I followed  so taken","So conditioned I could never let go","Then sorrow  then sickness","Then the shock when you flip it on me","So hollow  so vicious","That I could never be held","Back up  no  I&#x27;ll hold myself","Check the rep  yep you know my rail","Forget the rest let them know my hell","Kept respect up the vets stay their","Let the rest be to tell they tale","That I was there saying","And these promises broken","Deep  feeble","Each word gets lost in the echo","So one last lie I can see through","This time I finally let you","Go  go  go","Test my will  test my heart","Y&#x27;all go hard  I go smart","I&#x27;ve seen that frustration","And I&#x27;ve come back unshaken","Let down  I&#x27;ve lived and let go","So you can let it be known","I don&#x27;t hold back  I hold my own","I can&#x27;t sing flat  it aint my tone","I can&#x27;t fall back  I came too far","Hold myself up and love my scars","Let the bells ring wherever they are","Cause I was there saying","And these promises broken","Deep  feeble","Each word gets lost in the echo","So one last lie I can see through","This time I finally let you go","Go  go  go","No  you can tell &#x27;em all now","I don&#x27;t care where the enemies are","Won&#x27;t forget how I got this far","And every time  saying","And these promises broken","Deep  feeble","Each word gets lost in the echo","So one last lie I can see through","This time I finally let you"],"song":"14255"}
