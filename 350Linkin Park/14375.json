{"name":"Blackout","cover":"Linkin Park","content":["I&#x27;m stuck in this bed you made","Alone with a sinking feeling","I saw through the words you said","To the secrets you&#x27;ve been keeping","It&#x27;s written upon your face","All the lies how they cut so deeply","You can&#x27;t get enough you take","And take and take and never say","No you&#x27;ve gotta get it inside","No you&#x27;ll never get it inside","You say that it&#x27;s not your fault","And swear that I am mistaken","You said it&#x27;s not what it seems","You run but then back you fall","You can&#x27;t get enough you take","And take and take and take and take","F**k it are you listening","No you&#x27;ve gotta get it inside","No you&#x27;ll never get it inside","Push it back down you push it back down","No you&#x27;ve gotta get it inside","No you&#x27;ll never get it inside","Blackout blood in your eye","Push it back down you push it back down","You push it back down blood in your eye","Floating down as colors fill the light","A future gazing out a past to overwrite","So come down far below","Come down far below","Come down oh","Come down oh","Come down oh","Come down oh","Come down oh"],"song":"14375"}
