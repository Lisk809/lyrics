{"name":"Sacrament of Wilderness","cover":"Nightwish","content":["Naked in midwinter magic","Lies an angel in the snow","An encounter symbolic yet truthful","With a hungry choir of wolves","An agreement immemorial to be born","Dulcet elvenharps from a dryad forest","Accompany all charming tunes","Of a sacrament by a campfire","A promise between the tameless","And the one with a tool","Tonight the journey from a cave begins","I want to hunt with the tameless heart","We will honor the angel in the snow","From my cave i watch the land untamed","And wonder if some becoming season","Will make the angel melt in shame","I want to hunt with the tameless heart","I want to hunt with the tameless heart","We will honor the angel in the snow"],"song":"23511"}
