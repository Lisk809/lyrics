{"name":"Ã‰lan","cover":"Nightwish","content":["In tongues from the time before man","Listen to a daffodil tell her tale","Let the guest in walk out be","The first to greet the morn","The meadows of heaven awaits harvest","The elsewhere creatures yet unseen","Come","Taste the wine","Race the blind","They will guide you from the light","Writing noughts till the end of time","Come","Surf the clouds","Race the dark","It feeds from the runs undone","Meet me where the cliffs greets the sea","Is in dead leaves and fleeting skies","Returning swans and sedulous mice","A house of cards from a worn out deck","Come","Taste the wine","Race the blind","They will guide you from the light","Writing noughts till the end of time","Come","Surf the clouds","Race the dark","It feeds from the runs undone","Meet me where the cliffs greets the sea","Riding hard every shooting star","Come","Taste the wine","Race the blind","They will guide you from the light","Writing noughts till the end of time","Oh come","Surf the clouds","Race the dark","It feeds from the runs undone","Meet me where the cliffs greets the sea","Come"],"song":"23459"}
