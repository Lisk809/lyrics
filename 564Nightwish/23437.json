{"name":"Higher Than Hope","cover":"Nightwish","content":["Higher Than Hope","Time it took the most of me","And left me with no key","To unlock the chest of remedy","Mother  the pain ain&#x27;t hurting me","But the love that I feel","When you hold me near","The hopes were high","The choirs were vast","Red Sun rising","Drown without inhaling","Within  the dark holds hard","Passiontide","An angel by my side","But no Christ to end this war","To deliver my soul from the sword","Hope has shown me a scenery","Paradise poetry","With first snow I&#x27;ll be gone","The hopes were high","The choirs were vast","Red Sun rising","Drown without inhaling","Within  the dark holds hard","Red Sun rising","Curtain falling","Higher than hope my cure lies","Your death saved me","Red Sun rising","Drown without inhaling","Within  the dark holds hard","Red Sun rising","Curtain falling","Higher than hope my cure lies","Red Sun rising","Drown without inhaling","Within  the dark holds hard","Red Sun rising","Curtain falling","Higher than hope my cure lies"],"song":"23437"}
