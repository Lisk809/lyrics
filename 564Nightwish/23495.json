{"name":"Slaying the Dreamer","cover":"Nightwish","content":["You bathed in my wine","Drank from my cup, mocked my rhyme","Put a stake through my heart!","And drag me into sunlight","So awake for your greed","As you&#x27;re slaying the dreamer","Swansong for the Wish of Night","God it hurts, give a name to the pain","Put a stake through my heart!","And drag me into sunlight","So awake for your greed","As you&#x27;re slaying the dreamer","Blame me, it&#x27;s me","Dumb kid, living a dream","Romantic only on paper","Tell me why you took all that was mine!","Tell me why you took all that was mine!","Wake up, mow the weed","You&#x27;d be nothing without me","You bastards tainted my tool","Raped my words, played me a fool","The Great Ones are all dead","And I&#x27;m tired, too","I truly hate you all!","END","END"],"song":"23495"}
