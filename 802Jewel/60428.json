{"name":"Absence of Fear","cover":"Jewel","content":["Inside my skin there is this space","It twists and turns","It bleeds and aches","It&#x27;s waiting for lightning","It&#x27;s waiting for you","And I am wanting","And I am needing you here","Inside the absence of fear","Muscle and sinew","Velvet and stone","This vessel is haunted","It creaks and moans","My bones call to you","In their separate skin","I make myself translucent","To let you in for","I am wanting","And I am needing of you here","Inside the absence of fear","There is this hunger","This restlessness inside of me","You&#x27;re my gravity","They will lay you out in moonlight","And reinvent your name","For I am wanting you","And I am needing you here","I need you near","Inside the absence of fear"],"song":"60428"}
