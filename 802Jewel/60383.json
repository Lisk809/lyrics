{"name":"No More Heartaches","cover":"Jewel","content":["I can no longer let myself stay close","To the one thing that hurts me the most","I will not kiss the thorn","There&#x27;ll be no more heartaches","No more heartaches for me","It&#x27;s overlooked by your lust","My song is unseen","Cause your touch is too tough","The subtlety of me anymore","I unfasten myself from your side","Slip away quiet as a sigh","There&#x27;ll be no more heartaches","Beds filled with suspicion","Hearts filled with spite","We sleep with thieves","And forego our sights","Too quick to hold","Someone&#x27;s word over our own","Can&#x27;t you see"],"song":"60383"}
