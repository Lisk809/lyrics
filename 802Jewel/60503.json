{"name":"Perfectly Clear","cover":"Jewel","content":["The doorway frames you","A picture perfect silhouette","Blue sky of regret","Enough to hang you","Your legs seem to tremble","At least I imagine that they do","I can read all the signs","I can take it from here","There&#x27;s no need to explain","It&#x27;s perfectly clear","Yellow wallpaper peels makes","A strange halo around your head","It&#x27;s funny how I notice","These stupid things instead","You say something awkward","But I wish that you wouldn&#x27;t","But just couldn&#x27;ts","I can read all the signs","I can take it from here","There&#x27;s no need to explain","It&#x27;s perfectly clear","So I try not to think to much","It only just makes me mad","Spent half my life loving you","Five years worth of kisses","Are packed in your bags","This tiny moment fits","All the big things we ever had","And I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint","When it left or what for","Love always steps lightly","Away from the door","I can read all the signs","I can take it from here","There&#x27;s no need to explain","No  there&#x27;s no need to explain","It&#x27;s perfectly clear"],"song":"60503"}
