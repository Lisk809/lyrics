{"name":"Last Dance Rodeo","cover":"Jewel","content":["Last Dance Rodeo","Jewel","Your lungs fill up with concrete","Her voice is all you can hear","Red lips and a screwdriver","And you know that she&#x27;s a diamond","In this damn juke box hell","&#x27;Cause fools gold only fools fools","But she&#x27;s cooler than all that","But under the gas lamp","The air is thick and velvety","Your bones filled with hunger","Your heart filled with longing","You&#x27;re no longer human","You&#x27;re an insatiable hole.","You wanna bury your face forever","In the navel of her soul","&#x27;Cause you know ...","All you need is a heart to call home","All you need is a heart to call home","That&#x27;s all.","Light bulbs, and nylons","And plastic chandeliers","Objects are only objects,","And tangerine lips","These things are eternal","Inside them humanity rests.","The skin is like a seashell","You listen to the soul","But under the gas lamp","The air is thick and velvety","Your bones filled with hunger","Your heart filled with longing","You&#x27;re no longer human","You&#x27;re an insatiable hole","You wanna bury your face forever","In the navel of her soul","&#x27;Cause you know ...","All you need is a heart to call home","All you need is a heart to call home","That&#x27;s all","But don&#x27;t wander too far","On one constant star","Darkness exists, except where you are","Your feet are filled with wandering","They follow your own","&#x27;Cause everywhere you are","Feels like home","So search all you miners","You hunters of dreams","Look in the alleyways","For what you know is not what it seems","And fame, all you maidens,","But don&#x27;t resist to long","But at least look behind you","And see your own shadow&#x27;s gone","You gotta find yourself a cowboy","Or someone to keep you","Warm when it cold","But under the gas lamp","The air is thick and velvety","Your bones filled with hunger","Your heart filled with longing","You&#x27;re no longer human","You&#x27;re an insatiable hole.","You wanna bury your face forever","In the navel of her soul","&#x27;Cause you know ...","All you need is a heart to call home","All you need is a heart to call home","All you need is a heart to call home","That&#x27;s all","That&#x27;s all"],"song":"60461"}
