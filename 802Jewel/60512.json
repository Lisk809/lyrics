{"name":"When You Loved Me","cover":"Jewel","content":["I look to the west","The sun blinds me I shade my eyes","Your gaze finds me I lose my breath","She looks at you","My head reels you look back","You make her feel like I used to","I recall when you first touched me","Haunted by your face above me","You it was always you","With your broken crown","Touched me like holy ground","And I so eager to believe","So sincere so naïve","Back when you loved me","I look to the sky","Small birds fly in a black line","Onе falls behind I hear it cry","The sun shines through","Your water glass it lights up her dress","It magnifies what I regret","I recall when you first touched me","Haunted by your face above me","You it was always you","With your broken crown","Touched me like holy ground","And I so eager to believe","So sincere so naïve","Back when you loved me","Living with your memory now","It&#x27;s being lost at sea now","It&#x27;s dragging me","It&#x27;s dragging me","Dragging me down","You it was always you","With your broken crown","Touched me like holy ground","And I consumed with poetry","The kind that brought me to my knees","Back when you loved me","I look to the west","I hope that bird has found its way","The sun slips away"],"song":"60512"}
