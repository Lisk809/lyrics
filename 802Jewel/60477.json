{"name":"You Were Meant For Me","cover":"Jewel","content":["I hear the clock it&#x27;s 6 a m","早上6点的时候，我听到闹铃响了","我感觉到你离我千里之远","I got my eggs and my pancakes too","我得到了鸡蛋得到了薄饼","I got my maple syrup everything but you","也得到了枫蜜，唯独没有得到你","我捣碎了蛋黄笑着做了个鬼脸","I kinda like it in my brand new place","我非常喜欢这个新地方","我擦去镜子上的污点，没有留下家门钥匙","我再也不把湿毛巾搁在地板上","因为梦仍在，甚至在你离开之后","我才知道你是爱我的，不就你将会看到","我为你而生，你因我而存在","我打电话给妈妈时，她告诉我出去散步了","只想冲杯咖啡安慰自己，不想再说片言只字","我拿起一张纸，里面写着的更多的是坏消息","不是被人伤害就是被人利用","Put on my coat in the pouring rain","我穿上外套，走进倾盆大雨中","I saw a movie it just wasnt the same","看过的电影都与以往不同","Cause it was happy or i was sad and","因为剧情是滑稽的，而我却格外忧郁","It made me miss you oh so bad cause","它让我非常思念你","因为梦仍在，甚至在你离开之后","我才知道你是爱我的，不就你将会看到","我为你而生，你因我而存在","我的生意做得风生水起，我的其他的事情也还顺利","只是你不在我身边","Same old story not much to say","就像古老的童话，不需多言","Hearts are broken every day","我每天都很伤心","我每天都戴着帽子刷牙","我知道你讨厌我离开时不关灯","我拿起一本书来看，不想过早睡眠","我深呼吸，再环顾一下四周","Put on my pjs and hop into bed","无奈换上睡衣，决定倒头大睡","我半睡半醒着，我心痛得快要窒息","I try to tell myself itll be all right","我试着告诉自己一切都会好起来","I shouldnt think anymore tonight cause","今夜就不要再想太多了","因为梦仍在，甚至在你离开之后","我才知道你是爱我的，不就你将会看到","我为你而生，你因我而存在","噢，我为你而生，你因我而存在"],"song":"60477"}
