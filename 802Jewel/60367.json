{"name":"O Little Town Of Bethlehem","cover":"Jewel","content":["O little town of bethlehem","How still we see thee lie","Above thy deep and dreamless sleep","The silent stars go by","Yet in thy dark streets shineth","The ever lasting light","The hopes and fears of all the years","Are met in thee tonight","For christ is born of mary","And gathered all above","While mortals sleep the angels keep","Their watch of wandering love","O morning stars together","Proclaim the holy birth","And praises sing to god the king","And peace to men on earth","O holy child of bethlehem","Descend to us we pray","Cast out our sin and enter in","Be born in us today","We hear the christmas angels","The great glad tidings tell","O come to us abide with us","Our lord immanuel","And peace to men on earth"],"song":"60367"}
