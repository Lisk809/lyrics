{"name":"Do You Think of Me","cover":"Mariah Carey","content":["I wonder if you think of me","Somewhere in the shadows of your mind","Although our love could never be","I find I think about you all the time","Am I in your fantasies","The way you always wander into mine","And are you longing endlessly","Just like me deep inside","When the nights are dark and cold","Do you think of me do you think of me","And when you&#x27;re lying all alone","Do you think of me do you think of me","When you feel the touch of another love","Do you think of me do you think of me","Am I the one you&#x27;re dreaming of","Do you think of me do you think of me","I picture you embracing me","But it&#x27;s only make believe","Love can be so unkind","When the nights are dark and cold","Do you think of me do you think of me","And when you&#x27;re lying all alone","Do you think of me do you think of me","When you feel the touch of another love","Do you think of me do you think of me","Am I the one you&#x27;re dreaming of","Do you think of me do you think of me","Tell me baby","&#x27;Cause I need you baby","Really love you baby","When the nights are dark and cold","Do you think of me do you think of me","And when you&#x27;re lying all alone","Do you think of me do you think of me","When you feel the touch of another love","Do you think of me do you think of me","Am I the one you&#x27;re dreaming of","Do you think of me do you think of me","When the nights are dark and cold","Do you think of me do you think of me","And when you&#x27;re lying all alone","Do you think of me do you think of me","When you feel the touch of another love","Do you think of me do you think of me","Am I the one you&#x27;re dreaming of","Do you think of me do you think of me","&#x27;Cause I think about you baby","When I&#x27;m all alone","I think of you","Yes I do"],"song":"19764"}
