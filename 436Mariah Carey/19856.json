{"name":"Underneath The Stars","cover":"Mariah Carey","content":["One summer night","We ran away for a while","Laughing we hurried beneath the sky","To an obscure place to hide","And we drifted to another state of mind","As we lay upon the grass","There in the dark","Underneath the stars","Underneath the stars","Oh baby","Weak in the knees","Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze","So shy a bundle of butterflies","Flush with heat of desire","On a natural high","As we drifted to another place in time","As I lost my heart to you","There in the dark","Underneath the stars","Beautiful and bittersweetly","You were fading into me","And I was gently fading into you","But the time went sailing by","Reluctantly we said goodbye","And left our secret place so far behind","And I lay in bed all night","And I was drifting","Drifting","Drifting","Drifting","Drifting","And I was yours","And you were my own","My own baby","As we lay","As we","Lay underneath the stars","Ohhhhh","Underneath the stars","Underneath the stars","Underneath the stars"],"song":"19856"}
