{"name":"You Are","cover":"于文文","content":["整个世界突然安静下来","安静的深处原来有人在","在银河迷雾之间 心跟着孤单摇摆","我们不过是偶然的尘埃","漂浮在半空的爱怎么爱","找不到天空依赖的云彩","你说的那个小孩 奔跑在荒芜地带","离开的人没说回来","只剩漫天的回忆残骸","Say you are you are","You will be left behind too far too far","用力的拥抱","温柔的身体里最寂寞的光","Hey you are you are","受过的伤害","像花朵盛开成无边山脉","逃不出白色浪潮的大海","呼唤着从没听过的未来","迷路的那个小孩 走失在谁的现在","留下的人凝结悲哀","忘了能怎么自我掩埋","Here you are you are","我们陷落在这陌生的海洋","不需要方向","Here you are you are","Memories of life falling behind","无声的流浪 可有一双翅膀","将心冲散","飞到无力飞翔"],"song":"8855"}
