{"name":"Love Is All","cover":"Yanni","content":["It was raining in my heart","Falling deep inside of me","Drowning into my soul","This silence rushes over me","I am breath against this fire","And I will not turn away oh no","I&#x27;m waiting for time to carry me","Like a tempest to the sea","Standing strong watching over yeah","Love will keep me believing","Holding on when I&#x27;m dreaming","Love is all love is all love is all","Thundering on high","Love was all I knew before I fell","And now the shots of man","Are buried inside myself","I am breath against this fire","And I will not turn away oh no","I&#x27;m waiting for time to carry me","Like a tempest to the sea","Standing strong watching over yeah","Love will keep me believing","Holding on when I&#x27;m dreaming","Love is all love is all love is all","Holding on when I&#x27;m dreaming","Love is all love is all","Love will keep me believing","Holding on when I&#x27;m dreaming","Love is all love is all love is all","Love is all love is all love is all","Love is all love is all","Like a tempest to the sea","Love love love love is all","Love is all"],"song":"50081"}
