{"name":"Kill Me With Your Love","cover":"Yanni","content":["Tell me who you are today","Different man  different heart","Now we stand worlds and worlds apart","Underneath the ruins at night","Color it is all I see","Your words mean nothing at all","I trust you to kill me with your love","Your words mean nothing at all","Lives touched with lies in this room","Descending from this high","Silence fills the void with a fire dye","Your words mean nothing at all","I trust you to kill me with your love","Your words mean nothing at all","Your words mean nothing at all","I trust you to kill me with your love","Your words mean nothing at all","Your words mean nothing at all","Your words mean nothing at all","Your words mean nothing at all","I trust you to kill me with your love","Your words mean nothing at all"],"song":"50094"}
