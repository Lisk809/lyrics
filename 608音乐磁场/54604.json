{"name":"Crying","cover":"音乐磁场","content":["I was alright for a while","I could smile for a while","Then I saw you last night","You held my hand so tight","When you stopped to say hello","You were wishing me well","You couldn&#x27;t tell","That I&#x27;d been crying over you","Crying over you","And you said so long","And left me standing all alone","Alone and crying crying crying crying","It&#x27;s hard to understand","That the touch of your hand","Can start me crying","I thought that I was over you","But it&#x27;s true oh so true","I love you even more than I did before","Oh darling what can I do","Crying over you crying over you","Crying crying over you"],"song":"54604"}
