{"name":"Crystal Lullaby","cover":"Carpenters","content":["Does anybody know where it goes","I remember the last time","The signs pointed home a month ago","Rented cars and empty motel rooms","Lead you everywhere but home","Crowds of people shouting","The endless crowds of faces","Just keep on wearing a smile","Please take me back home","I wonder if these feelings ever change","How many times I&#x27;ll lift this load","Come tomorrow I&#x27;ll be gone again","The endless crowds of faces","Just keep on wearing a smile","Please take me back home","I wonder if these feelings ever change","How many times I&#x27;ll lift this load"],"song":"19332"}
