{"name":"Sailing On The Tide","cover":"Carpenters","content":["Here I am feeling confined","Neon lights are making me blind","I need time out in the sunshine","The city and me just don&#x27;t agree","On who I should be","Maybe I should get away","Take myself a holiday","No more calls begging my time","No more walls for me to climb","I can&#x27;t wait to feel the sunshine","Leaving at dawn","After I&#x27;m gone life will go on","Someone&#x27;s gonna take my place","Runnin&#x27; in the human race","Sailing on the tide in the morning","Now I love that salty air","Sailing through the wide horizon","Let the fresh winds guide us there","Maybe if you feel like it  too","You might like to make the run","Over the ocean","To my beautiful island in the sun","Over there people are slow","Low key life is all that they know","Lying around high on the sunshine","Lazy lagoons  warm afternoons","Tropical moons","Sleepy beaches everywhere","Anyone is welcome there","Make no plans  play it by ear","Could be days or maybe a year","I&#x27;m gonna be free in the sunshine","Time to unwind","Nothin&#x27;s gonna hurry me","Nothin&#x27;s gonna worry me","Sailing on the tide in the morning","Now I love that salty air","Sailing through the wide horizon","Let the fresh winds guide us there","Maybe if you feel like it  too","You might like to make the run","Over the ocean","To my beautiful island in the sun","Sailing through the wide horizon","Let the fresh winds guide us there","Maybe if you feel like it  too","You might like to make the run","Sailing over the ocean","To my beautiful island in the sun"],"song":"19396"}
