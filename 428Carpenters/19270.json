{"name":"Weâ€™ve Only Just Begun","cover":"Carpenters","content":["We&#x27;ve only just begun to live","White lace and promises","We&#x27;ve only begun","Before all the rising sun we fly","So many roads to choose","We start our walking and learn to run","And yes We&#x27;ve just begun","Sharing horizons that are new to us","Watching the signs along the way","Talking it over just the two of us","Working together day to day","Together","And when the evening comes we smile","So much of life ahead","And yes We&#x27;ve just begun","Sharing horizons that are new to us","Watching the signs along the way","Talking it over just the two of us","Working together day to day","Together","Together","And when the evening comes we smile","So much of life ahead","And yes We&#x27;ve just begun"],"song":"19270"}
