{"name":"Wild Flower","cover":"王杰","content":["Each time her slender shoulder","Bore the weight of all her fears","And a sorrow no one hears","Let her cry for she&#x27;s a lady","Let her dream for she&#x27;s a child","Let the rain fall down upon her","And if by chance I should hold her","Let me hold her for a time","But if allowed but one possession","And so she goes And so she goes","Let her cry for she&#x27;s a lady","Let her dream for she&#x27;s a child","Let the rain fall down upon her","Let her cry for she&#x27;s a lady","Let her dream for she&#x27;s a child","Let the rain fall down upon her","She&#x27;s a flower growing wild","She&#x27;s a flower growing wild","She&#x27;s a flower growing wild"],"song":"3931"}
