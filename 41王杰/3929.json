{"name":"You’re My Everything","cover":"王杰","content":["All my everything","There&#x27;s nothing that can harm you","In the lonely night","I&#x27;ll come to you","And keep you safe and warm","It&#x27;s so strong my love","When I kiss your lips","I feel the rolling thunder","To my fingertips","And all the while my head is in a spin","Deep within I&#x27;m in love","When I kiss your lips","I live up on the land","And see the sky above","I swim within her ocean","Sweet and warm","There&#x27;s no storm my love","You&#x27;re my everything","And nothing really matters","But the love you bring","You&#x27;re my everything","To see you in the morning","With those big brown eyes","You&#x27;re my everything","Forever and a day","I need you close to me","You&#x27;re my everything","You never have to worry never fear","For I am near","All my everything","I swim within her ocean sweet and warm","There&#x27;s no storm my love","You&#x27;re my everything","And nothing really matters","But the love you bring","You&#x27;re my everything","To see you in the morning","With those big brown eyes","You&#x27;re my everything","Forever and a day","I need you close to me","You&#x27;re my everything","You never have to worry never fear","For I am near","When I hold you tight","Yet so strong my love"],"song":"3929"}
