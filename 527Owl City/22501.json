{"name":"I Found Love(Commentary)","cover":"Owl City","content":["I was so young and reckless","It was all a blur but there you were","And your love left me breathless","When the fairy dust fell over us","Yeah I I felt I could fly","&#x27;Cause I I found love","So take my hand and shed a tear","But love goes on and on forever","It&#x27;s so dark in my mind","I &#x27;cross my heart and hope to die","I&#x27;m so bad at goodbyes","I hold my breath","I hold my breath and close my eyes","I don&#x27;t have a lot left","Oh how did it end so fast","I say with my last breath","It&#x27;s a perfect day to float away","It&#x27;s a perfect day","When the sparks flew between us","I saw you glow and had to know","Where our journey would lead us","Til&#x27; the story end and back again","Yeah I I felt I could fly","&#x27;Cause I I found love","So lead me home and lift me up","Above the stars and even higher","I&#x27;m not afraid because your love","It falls like rain and burns like fire","It&#x27;s so dar","It&#x27;s so dark in my mind in my mind","I &#x27;cross my heart","I&#x27;m so bad","I&#x27;m so bad at goodbyes at goodbyes","I hold my breath","I don&#x27;t have a lot left","Oh how did it end so fast","I say with my last breath","It&#x27;s a perfect day","I&#x27;ll love you forever","And you were my dream come true","I say with my last breat","It&#x27;s a perfect day","Yeah I I felt I could fly","&#x27;Cause I I found love"],"song":"22501"}
