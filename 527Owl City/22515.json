{"name":"Strawberry Avalanche","cover":"Owl City","content":["This is a world of dreams and reverie","A grasp light flashed with a gleam","As it slashed open a moon beam","And I stared back breathlessly","As mountains of fruit tumbled out","I barely had the chance to shout","A strawberry avalanche crashed over me","Deep in a sleeping bag in your backyard","When we woke up buried alive","Beneath the fruity landslide","We both laughed hysterically","But I swear I heard you scream","A strawberry avalanche crashed over me","Always a citrus constellation","Of both my eye lids that","I&#x27;ve been dying to see","If you were a beautiful sound","And the echo&#x27;s all around","Then I&#x27;d be your harmony","Beneath the candy coated clouds","See the world of dreams and reverie"],"song":"22515"}
