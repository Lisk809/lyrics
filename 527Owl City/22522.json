{"name":"On The Wing","cover":"Owl City","content":["And we&#x27;ll stir the stars around","And plummet out of sight and sound","Where I live in the alpine heights","A thousand miles from the tide","Distract me so I stay inside","Cuz I would make a hook and eye","We&#x27;re hanging on so take us high","I am floating away","Lost in a silent ballet","Awake to take in the view","Late nights and early parades","Still photos and noisy arcades","And we can go anywhere","Are you there&#x27;","I am floating away","Lost in a silent ballet","Awake to take in the view","Late nights and early parades","Still photos and noisy arcades","And we can go anywhere","Are you there&#x27;","Are you there&#x27;"],"song":"22522"}
