{"name":"Last Night","cover":"王力宏","content":["Last night","昨晚","I watched you sleep as you laying there","当你躺下时我看着你入睡","我跪在地上祈祷","我学会温柔地亲吻你美丽的脸庞","但我无法穿过你优雅的海洋","月光高高笼罩你,绘出一幅宁静的画","唯一的声音只是从东方吹来的微风","我的心平静地跳动着，跟着你温柔呼吸的节奏","And the whole world calmed down","整个世界冷静了下来","For this moment of rest","在这个时刻","此刻我正站着努力不去告诉你我爱你","还有在这个世界上我想要的只是你","If you&#x27;d only wake up","如果你会醒来","You&#x27;d know it was true","你会知道这是真的","Oh  baby","哦,宝贝","我爱你太难说出口","特别是当用这样强烈的方式","But at this moment while you lie asleep","但在这个时刻当你入睡","I am suddenly free","我突然感到释放了","And my trembling arms reach out for you","我颤抖的双臂在靠近你","As if you could see","要是你可以看见多好","此刻我正站着努力不去告诉你我爱你","还有在这个世界上我想要的只是你","If you&#x27;d only wake up","如果你会醒来","You&#x27;d know it was true","你会知道这是真的","If you&#x27;d only wake up","如果你会醒来","You&#x27;d know  it was true","你会知道这是真的"],"song":"50778"}
