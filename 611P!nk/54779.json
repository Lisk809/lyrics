{"name":"But We Lost It","cover":"P!nk","content":["They say everything is temporary","Who the hell are they anyways","I wanna know where does love go to die","Is it some sad empty castle in the sky","I cry maybe time isn&#x27;t on our side","We had a thing but we lost it","I know we never been quite here before","I wish I knew it when we lost it","You used to try to wake the beast in me","I have been waiting to come alive","And now I&#x27;m living all alone","In these four walls","I think we had it but we lost it","I want the same things we did back then","I know we had it but we lost it","Oh the bone breaks","It grows back stronger","Oh the bone breaks","It grows back stronger","The bone breaks","It grows back stronger","Oh the bone breaks","I cry maybe time isn&#x27;t on our side","We had a thing but we lost it","I know we never been quite here before","I wish I knew it when we lost it","Yeah I wish I knew it when we lost it"],"song":"54779"}
