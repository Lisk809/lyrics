{"name":"Beam Me Up","cover":"P!nk","content":["In a parallel universe","Where nothing breaks and nothing hurts","Blades of grass on tiny bare feet","Could you beam me up","Beam me up","I think a minute&#x27;s enough","Just beam me up","Saw a blackbird soarin&#x27; in the sky","Barely a breath I caught one last sight","It only happens when I&#x27;m on my own","Could you beam me up","Beam me up","I think a minute&#x27;s enough","Just beam me up","In my head I see your baby blues","I hear your voice and I I break in two","And now there&#x27;s one of me with you","Just beam me up","Beam me up","I think a minute&#x27;s enough","Beam me up","Beam me up","Beam me up","Could you beam me up"],"song":"54709"}
