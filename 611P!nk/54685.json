{"name":"Iâ€™m Not Dead","cover":"P!nk","content":["Crack in the mirror, on your lips","It&#x27;s the moment of a sunset Friday","When our conversations twist","But the ice should be on our heads","So we weren&#x27;t left for death","I&#x27;m not dead just floating","Right between the ink of your tattoo","I&#x27;m not scared just changing","You&#x27;re my crack of sunlight","You can do the math a thousand ways","But you can&#x27;t erase the facts","That others come and others go","But you always come back","I&#x27;m a winter flower underground","Always thirsty for summer rain","And just like the change of seasons","I know you&#x27;ll be back again","I&#x27;m not dead just floating","Underneath the ink of my tattoo","I&#x27;m not scared just changing","You&#x27;re my crack of sunlight, oh","I&#x27;m not dead just yet","Underneath the cuts and bruises","I&#x27;m not dead just floating","I&#x27;m not scared just changing","You&#x27;re my crack of sunlight, yeah"],"song":"54685"}
