{"name":"Walk Away","cover":"P!nk","content":["I gave you three years of my life","You always said I&#x27;ll be your wife","Everyone knows my name","And gave me a broken heart","You don&#x27;t wanna work it out, no","You wanna take it easy, well","Throw your hands up and you walk away,","When its so easy for you to walk away","So here I am driving down the street","Looking for a sign","When will I meet, the man of my dreams","Coz I&#x27;m sick of trying,","But baby I&#x27;m gonna move on","You didn&#x27;t wanna work it out, no","You wouldn&#x27;t take it easy, well","Threw your hands up and you walk away,","So there I go leaving you alone","Coz I&#x27;m sick of trying,","But baby I&#x27;m gonna move on","You didn&#x27;t wanna work it out, no","You wouldn&#x27;t take it easy, well","Threw your hands up and you walk away,","Threw your hands up and you walk away,","I&#x27;m gonna do the same","I&#x27;m gonna walk away","So hard to feel relay","So hard to feel relay","I&#x27;m gonna walk away"],"song":"54835"}
