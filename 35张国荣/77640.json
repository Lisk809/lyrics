{"name":"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams","cover":"张国荣","content":["I walk along the street of sorrow","The boulevard of broken dreams","Where gigolo and gigolette","Can take a kiss without regret","Till they forget their broken dreams","You laugh tonight and cry tomorrow","When you behold your shattered schemes","And gigolo and gigolette","Wake up to find their eyes are wet","With tears that tell of broken dreams","Here is where you always find me","Always walking up and down","But I left my soul behind me","In an old cathedral town","The joy that you find here borrow","You cannot keep it long seems","And gigolo and gigolette","Still sing a song and dance along","The boulevard of broken dreams","Da","Da","Da","The joy that you find here borrow","You cannot keep it long seems","And gigolo and gigolette","Still sing a song and dance along","The boulevard of broken dreams"],"song":"77640"}
