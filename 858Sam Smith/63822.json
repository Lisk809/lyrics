{"name":"Impossible","cover":"Sam Smith","content":["A little girl I found crying","Crying for hunger crying for laughter","She needed a home she needed shelter","So took her hand gave her my love","When she was just a small girl","He Papa sold her","It&#x27;s impossible for me to love you","It&#x27;s impossible for me","I can&#x27;t pretend you have a smile","You have a future being a good boy","Years of silence no games to play","Let me take you back to your childhood","Be there to take you by the hand","Move to victory","You&#x27;ll be strong and find a way","But you&#x27;ll have to let me","It&#x27;s impossible for me to love you","It&#x27;s impossible for me","Come with me","I&#x27;ll get you out","Of this big fat hole surrounding you","Take the road to another world","Impossible for them to hurt you","But possible for you and me","Possible for me to love you","Now it&#x27;s possible for me"],"song":"63822"}
