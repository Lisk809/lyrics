{"name":"My Love","cover":"Sam Smith","content":["If tomorrow is judgment day","And I&#x27;m standing on the front line","I will say I spent it with you","If I wake up in World War III","I see destruction and poverty","And I feel like I want to go home","&#x27;Cause your love is my love","And my love is your love","It would take an eternity to break us","&#x27;Cause your love is my love","And my love is your love","It would take an eternity to break us","If I lose my fame and fortune","And I&#x27;m homeless on the street","As the years they pass us by","And no matter how old we get","&#x27;Cause your love is my love","And my love is your love","It would take an eternity to break us","&#x27;Cause your love is my love","And my love is your love","It would take an eternity to break us","If I should die this very day","And no matter what the people say","&#x27;Cause your love is my love","And my love is your love","It would take an eternity to break us","&#x27;Cause your love is my love","And my love is your love","It would take an eternity to break us"],"song":"63817"}
