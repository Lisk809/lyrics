{"name":"Put on Your White Sombrero","cover":"Dana Winner","content":["Put on your white sombrero","Saddle your horse my dear","And ride off into the sunset","You better go","For there is no place for you here","Like an old fashioned hero","You stand before me","You think I like this movie","My world is real I even feel","And I can do without you","Put on your white sombrero","Your red bandana too","Think of this day as a showdown","Goodbye my friend","This is the end for me and you","Now be a bold vaquero","Don&#x27;t show your feelings","Into the night and dressed in white","Unchained and free without me","Put on your white sombrero","Like all cowboys do","Go find a sweet senorita","Somebody meek who never speaks","Hursly to you","You&#x27;re such a caballero","Proud never bending","I want someone","Who will take me just as I am","I need a man","Who is in rhyme with his time","Oh you never take me just as I am","I need a man","Who is in rhyme with his time"],"song":"62316"}
