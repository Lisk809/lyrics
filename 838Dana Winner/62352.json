{"name":"Streets Of London","cover":"Dana Winner","content":["Have you seen the old man","In the closed down market","In his eyes you see no pride","Hands held loosely at his side","Let me take you by the hand","I&#x27;ll show you something","To make you change your mind","Have you seen the old girl","Who walks the streets of London","She&#x27;s no time for talking","She just keeps right on walking","Carrying her home in two carrier bags","Let me take you by the hand","I&#x27;ll show you something","To make you change your mind","Let me take you by the hand","I&#x27;ll show you something","To make you change your mind","Have you seen the old man","Outside the seaman&#x27;s mission","For one more forgotten hero","And a world that doesn&#x27;t care","Let me take you by the hand","I&#x27;ll show you something","To make you change your mind"],"song":"62352"}
