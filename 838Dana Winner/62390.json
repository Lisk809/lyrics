{"name":"From Both Sides","cover":"Dana Winner","content":["Rows and flows of angel hair","And ice cream castles in the air","And feather canyons everywhere","I&#x27;ve looked at clouds that way","But now they only block the sun","They rain and snow on everyone","So many things I would have done","But clouds got in my way","From up and down and still somehow","I really don&#x27;t know clouds at all","Moons and Junes and ferries wheels","The dizzy dancing way you feel","As every fairy tale comes real","I&#x27;ve looked at love that way","But now it&#x27;s just another show","You leave &#x27;em laughing when you go","Don&#x27;t give yourself away","From give and take and still somehow","I really don&#x27;t know love at all","Tears and fears and feeling proud","To say I love you right out loud","Dreams and schemes and circus crowds","I&#x27;ve looked at life that way","In living every day","From win and lose and still somehow","I really don&#x27;t know life at all"],"song":"62390"}
