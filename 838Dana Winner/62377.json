{"name":"Chasing Butterflies","cover":"Dana Winner","content":["Today I feel like walking","Today I have to go","I was lying in my bed","With a twitter in my head","It sounds so good","Come on it&#x27;s time to go","Oh it&#x27;s been so long","But I knew it straight away","I thought at once","That this would be another perfect day","So I jumped out of my bed","Drank some coffee had some bread","And off I went a smile upon my face","Like the clouds so high","I follow birds in to the sky","Even if I do not know their way","Oh there&#x27;s spring in my heart","A touch of summer in the air","I&#x27;ll be chasing butterflies today","And if you want to follow","Just come along with me","And if you want to go sailing","I&#x27;ll gladly come on board","Like the clouds so high","I follow birds in to the sky","Even if I do not know their way","Oh there&#x27;s spring in my heart","A touch of summer in the air","I&#x27;ll be chasing butterflies today","Oh maybe I&#x27;ve been hiding","&#x27;Cause here&#x27;s the sun","So goodbye clouds","And goodbye rain","It&#x27;s plain for me to see","That this is me","Oh I feel free","Like the clouds so high","I follow birds in to the sky","Even if I do not know their way","Oh there&#x27;s spring in my heart","A touch of summer in the air","I&#x27;ll be chasing butterflies today","I&#x27;ll be chasing butterflies today"],"song":"62377"}
