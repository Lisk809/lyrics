{"name":"Een Lied Voor Kinderen","cover":"Dana Winner","content":["Ik heb alleen de tijd verplaatst","Nu ze stilaan uitgespeeld zijn","Een lied dat zingt geeft ze de ruimte","Een lied dat dartelt in de zon","Over dicht bijzijnde polders","Over de wijde horizon","Over een stad die autovrij was","Met een muziektent op de markt","En een eindeloze speeltuin","En met natuurlijk ook een park","Diediediediediedaidaidam","Diediediediediediedaidam","Diediediediediedaidaidam","Diediediediediediedaidam","Stel je voor","Je kon er spelen","In de straten op het plein","Ongestoord kon je er hink&#x27;len","De stad zou helemaal van jou zijn","Ergens hoor je kind&#x27;ren tellen","En je telt mee acht negen tien","En je hoort na al die jaren","Wie niet weg is is gezien","Diediediediediedaidaidam","Diediediediediediedaidam","Diediediediediedaidaidam","Diediediediediediedaidam","In het land van koning welvaart","Morgen zullen ze niet meer spelen","Hun spel is vogelvrij verklaard","Een liedje voor kleine zielige vogels","Die als kind&#x27;ren zijn vermomd","Wier vleugels men heeft kortgeknipt","Hun gezang is haast verstomd","Diediediediediedaidaidam","Diediediediediediedaidam","Diediediediediedaidaidam","Diediediediediediedaidam"],"song":"62311"}
