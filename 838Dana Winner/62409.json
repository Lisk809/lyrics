{"name":"Somewhere Over The Rainbow","cover":"Dana Winner","content":["Somewhere over the rainbow","Way up high","And the dreams that you dreamed of","Once in a lullaby","Somewhere over the rainbow","Blue birds fly","And the dreams that you dreamed of","Dreams really do come true ooh oh","Someday I&#x27;ll wish upon a star","Where trouble melts like lemon drops","High above the chimney top","That&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll find me","And the dream that you dare to","Oh why oh why can&#x27;t I","Someday I&#x27;ll wish upon a star","Where trouble melts like lemon drops","High above the chimney top","That&#x27;s where you&#x27;ll find me","Oh somewhere over the rainbow","Way up high","And the dream that you dare to dream","Oh why oh why can&#x27;t I"],"song":"62409"}
