{"name":"Iâ€™ll Be Home On Christmas Day","cover":"Blue","content":["On the hills of Georgia","Across the plains of Tennessee","That a man can do or see","But if I could only borrow","One dream from your sleep","Be on that train tomorrow","I&#x27;ll be home on Christmas day","And so many times before","She left that candle burning","Oh  too many tears have fell","My soul fill with yearning","If I had any sense at all","I&#x27;d just be on my way","Be on that train tomorrow","Be home on Christmas day","Every time I think about her","All the love I left behind","Memories still linger","In my troubled mind","I could set aside my pride","And I&#x27;d be on my way","I&#x27;d catch that train tomorrow","And be home on Christmas day","I had any sense at all","I&#x27;d just be on my way","I&#x27;d catch that train tomorrow","I&#x27;d be home on Christmas day","I&#x27;d be home  Christmas day&quot;"],"song":"55964"}
