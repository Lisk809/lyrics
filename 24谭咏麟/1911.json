{"name":"This Crazy Heart","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["Pack my bag and lock the door","I can hardly wait","Catch a taxi catch a star","I&#x27;ll be on my way","On a big jetliner in the sky","Carrying me straight to my dream","Love won&#x27;t pass me by","This crazy heart has got to fly","Fly away fly away","Got my ticket got my flight","Got my gypsy shoes","Gonna leave my blues behind","Make my dream come true","Will she wait for me","Down the runway can&#x27;t be late","She&#x27;s the one I need","But I&#x27;ll never rest until I try","Lettin&#x27; her know I love her so","Love won&#x27;t pass me by","This crazy heart has got to fly","Fly away fly away","Pack my bag and lock the door","I can hardly wait","Catch a taxi catch a star","I&#x27;ll be on my way","Catch a taxi catch a star","I&#x27;ll be on my way"],"song":"1911"}
