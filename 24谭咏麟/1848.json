{"name":"Look Both Ways","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["Livin&#x27; high under the party lights","Dancin&#x27; the night away","Show girls, gigolos, see and be seen","When it&#x27;s time to go","Save the last dance for me","They say the lights are always brighter","On the other side of the street","But can&#x27;t you see","You don&#x27;t need another lover","Woh.... woh....","Hot spots, cafe bars, lost in the crowd","Till the glitter fades","Baby, keep in mind, i feel the same","True love&#x27;s hard to find","Don&#x27;t you throw my love away","They say the lights are always brighter","On the other side of the street","But can&#x27;t you see","You don&#x27;t need another lover","Woh.... woh...."],"song":"1848"}
