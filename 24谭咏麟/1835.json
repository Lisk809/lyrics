{"name":"Dry Flower","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["Dream that I never had","Since the pedals die","It was all just like a simple matter","Now that we stand apart","Times the only hope I see","Nothing left surely nothing to regain","Longing for the days with you","I won&#x27;t forget","Looking at the flower leaves","I won&#x27;t regret to the end","I believe the flower bloom again","It won&#x27;t take too long","My dream will never be gone","Now that we stand apart","Times the only hope I see","Nothing left surely nothing to regain","Longing for the days with you","I won&#x27;t forget","Looking at the flower leaves","I won&#x27;t regret to the end","I believe the flower bloom again","It won&#x27;t take too long","My dream will never be gone","I believe the flower bloom again","It won&#x27;t take too long","My dream will never be gone"],"song":"1835"}
