{"name":"The Dark Midnite","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["I was a past from day to night","I going down taking a long long ride","Moment of views outside my window","How long has it gone","The train is getting far from home","When the sun fade away behind the night","The dark midnight comes to my sight","I feel right up the town that I left","Is time to begin for tomorrow","How long has it gone","The train is getting far from home","When the sun fade away behind the night","The dark midnight comes to my sight","I feel right up the town that I left","Is time to begin for tomorrow"],"song":"1833"}
