{"name":"Heart Full Of Soul","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["Sick at heart and lonely","Deep in dark despair","Thinking one thought only","Where is she tell me where","And if she says to you","She doesn&#x27;t love me","Just give her my message","Tell her of my plea","And I know if she had me back again","Well I would never make her sad","I&#x27;ve got a heart full of soul","She&#x27;s been gone such a long time","Longer then I can bear","But if sah says she wants me","Tell her that I&#x27;ll be there","And if she says to you","She doesn&#x27;t love me","Just give her my message","Tell her of my plea","And I know if she had me back again","Well I would never make her sad","I&#x27;ve got a heart full of soul","And I know if she had me back again","Well I would never make her sad","I&#x27;ve got a heart full of soul"],"song":"2146"}
