{"name":"Where Are You Now","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["Once this was our favorite place","Once we&#x27;d often e on a date","And we&#x27;d sit watching the ships","Sail into the evening mist","You would always smile like a child","And you&#x27;d say maybe someday","You would sail away","Where are you now  my love","I can&#x27;t help but think about you","I sit alone each night","And look at the lights","Dreamin&#x27; of times","How it used to be","Where are you now  my love","I just can&#x27;t go on without you","All alone since you&#x27;ve gone","Across the sea","Where are you now","Where are you now","Once the harbor lights held a charm","Once I held you close in my arms","Of the places we would see","Now alone in our favorite place","As the sun begins to set","On another day","Where are you now  my love","I can&#x27;t help but think about you","I sit alone each night","And look at the lights","Dreamin&#x27; of times","How it used to be","Where are you now  my love","I just can&#x27;t go on without you","All alone since you&#x27;ve gone","Across the sea","Where are you now","Where are you now","Where are you now  my love","I can&#x27;t help but think about you","I sit alone each night","And look at the lights","Dreamin&#x27; of times","How it used to be","Where are you now  my love","I just can&#x27;t go on without you","All alone since you&#x27;ve gone","Across the sea","Where are you now","Where are you now"],"song":"1909"}
