{"name":"Till We Said Goodbye","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["No more wine and roses","An open door that closes","Where&#x27;s the joy and laughter","Where&#x27;s forever after","And I know the way I feel inside","The way I hide behind my pride","I cry a lot behind my smile","And hope that in a little while","Learning to forget you","Forget I ever met you","Memories that haunt you","Crying out I want you","Suddenly","And had I known it from the start","I would have saved my broken heart","I gave it all to you","I counted on forever","Until the day you said goodbye","I gave all my love to you","Until the day you said goodbye","I dreamed we&#x27;d go on forever","Until the day you said goodbye","I believed we&#x27;d belong together","Until the day you said goodbye","My love  have the roses died","They died the day you said goodbye","After all  all the roses died","They died the day you said goodbye","Ooh","After all  all the roses died"],"song":"1834"}
