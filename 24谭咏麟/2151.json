{"name":"What A Woman Wants To Hear","cover":"谭咏麟","content":["So I asked you if you wanted to dance","So get ready for some romance tonight","Baby, share some body language with me","Skip the small talk about the weather","Forget the headline news","Baby, let it wait","&#x27;Cause I wanna say","Sweet nothings to you","Let me whisper in your ear","What a woman wants to hear","When nobody else is near","And the lights are all way down low","Let me whisper soft and clear","What a woman wants to hear","From a man who&#x27;s so sincere","Darling, I want you to know","I love you so","Maybe later when the music is through","I can take you to a new rendezvous","No more idle conversation","And no more playin&#x27; games","Baby, when we kiss","I get serious, so do it again","Let me whisper in your ear","What a woman wants to hear","When nobody else is near","And the lights are all way down low","Let me whisper soft and clear","What a woman wants to hear","From a man who&#x27;s so sincere","Darling, I want you to know","I love you so","Let me whisper in your ear","What a woman wants to hear","When nobody else is near","And the lights are all way down low","Let me whisper soft and clear","What a woman wants to hear","From a man who&#x27;s so sincere","Darling, I want you to know","I love you so"],"song":"2151"}
