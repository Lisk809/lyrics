{"name":"Big White Room","cover":"Jessie J","content":["Sitting in a big white room alone","Close my eyes to see in the dark","I feel young, broken, so so scared","I don＇t wanna be here anymore","like I used to be","With little old me","I＇m going crazy, I＇m losing my mind","I＇m going crazy, I＇m losing my mind","Sitting in a big white room alone","no oh","I clench my fist and try to stay strong","I cry, feel sick my hearts beating","Can I run, run faster than you","I wanna  feel my body again,","Cuz＇ no one else cares no","no no no no no no no oh","I＇m going crazy, I＇m losing my mind","I＇m going crazy, I＇m losing my mind","I＇m going crazy, I＇m losing my mind","I＇m going crazy, I＇m losing my mind"],"song":"60931"}
