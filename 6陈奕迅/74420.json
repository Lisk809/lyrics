{"name":"Aren&#x27;t You Glad","cover":"陈奕迅","content":["Bohemian life and instability","You went off to university","And you took your love away from me","Endless nights lovers friends and fun","And as the world turns on and on","Love is lost and love is won","Laughed and cried when we were young","You went your own way I survived","So now you live your life in luxury","Double glazing turbo washing machine","And your fianc is boring as hell","And as the world turns on and on","Love is lost and love is won","Laughed and cried when we were young","You went your own way I survived","And as the world turns on and on","Love is lost and love is won","Laughed and cried when we were young","You went your own way I survived","You didn&#x27;t want my love","So aren&#x27;t you glad","Aren&#x27;t you glad"],"song":"74420"}
