{"name":"R U N","cover":"陈奕迅","content":["Last night I had a dream","That I was on an endless run","I wasn t tired I wasn t scared","I couldn t stop but I didn t care","And it was then I passed the lake","at your reflection I turned to ask","Can anyone tell","That I am lost","Can anyone tell","That I am naked before you","That I am burning for you","however beautiful however mad","before I wake I just had to ask","Do you remember why you re here","Do you remember what","what in the world were you after","or were you running away somehow","I woke up both happy and sad","A little sorry a little glad"],"song":"74336"}
