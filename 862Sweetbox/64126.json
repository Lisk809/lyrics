{"name":"Sacred","cover":"Sweetbox","content":["Like a wind that&#x27;s slowly blowing","Like a dream that keeps you lounging","Even though I try to hide","Something&#x27;s changed in me","Cause we found something sacred","I&#x27;m not scared anymore","Cause we found something sacred","Something we can&#x27;t ignore","I&#x27;ve found you","Cause we found something sacred","So sacred And sweet","Like a kiss that keeps you yearning","When I feel your lips I start to cry","Baby  put your hands upon me","Leave me breathless tonight","I&#x27;m alive and unafraid","Unashamed With you","Cause we found something sacred","I&#x27;m not scared anymore","Cause we found something sacred","Something we can&#x27;t ignore","I&#x27;ve found you","Cause we found something sacred","So sacred And sweet","I&#x27;ve found you","Cause we found something sacred","So sacred And sweet"],"song":"64126"}
