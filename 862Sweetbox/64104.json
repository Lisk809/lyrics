{"name":"Stay","cover":"Sweetbox","content":["If this world is wearing thin","And you&#x27;re thinking of escape","I&#x27;ll go anywhere with you","Just wrap me up in chains","But if you try to go alone","Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll understand","Stay with me","Stay with me","In the silence of your room","In the darkness of your dreams","You must only think of me","There can be no in between","When your pride is on the floor","I&#x27;ll make you beg for more","Stay with me","Stay with me","You better hope and pray","You better hope and pray","That you wake one day in your own world","Cause when you sleep at night","Stay with me","Stay with me"],"song":"64104"}
