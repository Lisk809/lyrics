{"name":"Saving Grace","cover":"Soler","content":["Sent my soul into an orbit of anxiety","And this is what he said","&#x27;Forgive and then forget&#x27;","As I lay there in despair","He placed his hands upon my head","And as I wept","This is what he said","The light of saving grace&#x27;","After everything I&#x27;ve said","The snow has melted and today","I&#x27;m dancing in the sun","I still believe that he&#x27;s up there","Watching over me","I swear sometimes I hear","A whisper in my ear"],"song":"19446"}
