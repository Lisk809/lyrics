{"name":"After Hours","cover":"杨乃文","content":["If you close the door","The night could last forever","Leave the sunshine out","And say hello to never","All the people are dancing","And they&#x27;re having such fun","I wish it could happen to me","But if you close the door","If you close the door","The night could last forever","And drink a toast to never","Oh  someday i know","Someone will look into my eyes","And say hello","You&#x27;re my very special one","But if you close the door","Dark party bars  shiny cadillac cars","And the people on subways and trains","Looking gray in the rain","As they stand disarrayed","Oh  but people look well in the dark","And if you close the door","The night could last forever","Leave the sunshine out","And say hello to never","All the people are dancing","And they&#x27;re having such fun","I wish it could happen to me","Cause if you close the door"],"song":"60805"}
