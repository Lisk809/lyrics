{"name":"Bizarre Love Triangle","cover":"张惠妹","content":["Every time i think of you","I get a shot right through","Into a bolt of blue","It`s no problem of mine","But it`s a problem i find","There`s no sense in telling me","The wisdom of a fool won`t set you free","But that`s the way that it goes","And it`s what nobody knows","And every day my confusion grows","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment","You say the words that i can`t say","I feel fine and i feel good","I feel like i never should","Whenever i get this way","I just don`t know what to say","I`m not sure what this could mean","I don`t think you`re what you seem","I do admit to myself","That if i hurt someone else","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment","You say the words that i can`t say","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment","You say the words that i can`t say","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment","You say the words that i can`t say","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment","You say the words that i can`t say","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment","You say the words that i can`t say","Every time i see you falling","I get down on my knees and pray","I`m waiting for the final moment"],"song":"8700"}
