{"name":"When October Goes","cover":"林志炫","content":["And when October goes","The snow begins to fly","Above the smoky roofs","I watch the planes go by","The children running home beneath","A twilight sky","Oh","For the fun of them","When I was one of them","And when October goes","The same old dream appears","And you are in my arms","To share the happy years","I turn my head away to hide","The helpless tears","Oh","How I hate to see October go","And when October goes","The same old dream appears","And you are in my arms","To share the happy years","I turn my head away to hide","The helpless tears","Oh","How I hate to see October go","I should be over it now","I know","I hate to see October go"],"song":"35563"}
