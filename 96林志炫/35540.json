{"name":"The Power of Love","cover":"林志炫","content":["The whispers in the morning","Of lovers sleeping tight.","Are rolling like thunder now","As I look in your eyes.","I hold on to your body","And feel each move you make.","Your voice is warm and tender","A love that I could not forsake.","Cause you are my lady","And I am your man.","Whenever you reach for me","I&#x27;ll do all that I can.","Lost is how I&#x27;m feeling","Lying in your arms.","That all ends when I&#x27;m with you.","Even though there may be times","It seems I&#x27;m far away.","Never wonder where I am","Cause I am always by your side.","Cause you are my lady","And I am your man.","Whenever you reach for me","I&#x27;ll do all that I can.","We&#x27;re heading for someday","Somewhere I&#x27;ve never been.","Sometimes I am frightened but","I&#x27;m ready to learn","Of the power of love.","The sound of your heart beating.","Made it clear suddenly.","The feeling that I can&#x27;t go on","Is light years away.","Cause  you are my lady","And I am your man.","Whenever you reach for me","I&#x27;ll do all that I can.","We&#x27;re heading for someday","Somewhere I&#x27;ve never been.","Sometimes I am frightened but","I&#x27;m ready to learn","Of the power of love."],"song":"35540"}
