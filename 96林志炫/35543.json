{"name":"Take a Bow","cover":"林志炫","content":["Take a bow, the night is over","This masquerade is getting older","Light are low, the curtains down","There&#x27;s no one here","Say your lines but do you feel them","I&#x27;ve always been in love with you","Make them laugh, it comes so easy","When you get to the part","Where you&#x27;re breaking my heart","Wish you well, i cannot stay","I&#x27;ve always been in love with you","All the world is a stage","And everyone has their part","How was i to know you&#x27;d break","You&#x27;d break my heart","I&#x27;ve always been in love with you","Guess you&#x27;ve always known"],"song":"35543"}
