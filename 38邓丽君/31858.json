{"name":"Careless Whisper","cover":"邓丽君","content":["I feel so unsure","As I take your hand","And lead you to the dance floor","As the music dies","Something in your eyes","Calls to mind a silver screen","And all its sad goodbyes","I&#x27;m never gonna dance again","Guilty feet have got no rhythm","Though it&#x27;s easy to pretend","I know you&#x27;re not a fool","So I&#x27;m never gonna dance again","The way I danced with you","Time can never mend","The careless whispers of a good friend","To the heart and mind","Ignorance is kind","There&#x27;s no comfort in the truth","Pain is all you&#x27;ll find","I&#x27;m never gonna dance again","Guilty feet have got no rhythm","Though it&#x27;s easy to pretend","I know you&#x27;re not a fool","So I&#x27;m never gonna dance again","The way I danced with you","I&#x27;m never gonna dance again","Guilty feet have got no rhythm","Though it&#x27;s easy to pretend","I know you&#x27;re not a fool","So I&#x27;m never gonna dance again","The way I danced with you"],"song":"31858"}
