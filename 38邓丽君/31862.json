{"name":"Love The World Away","cover":"邓丽君","content":["Every now and then","When the world steps in","Stealing all our time away","It soon takes so much","We forget to touch","Thats when I know","Its time for me to say","Take my hand","Lets walk through loves door","And be free from the world once more","Cares my heart","We can hide today","And love the world away","Once again we&#x27;ll be","Where our hearts are free","And the time is ours to share","Love will always stay","Just a touch away","Come with me","All the magic&#x27;s waiting there","Take my hand","Lets walk through loves door","And be free from the world once more","Cares my heart","We can hide today","And love the world away","We can love the world away"],"song":"31862"}
