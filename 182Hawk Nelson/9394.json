{"name":"Right Here","cover":"Hawk Nelson","content":["Knowing I could never change your mind","I look into your eyes for the last time","I have realized for the first time","To let you know that I&#x27;m down","Have all my questions been ignored","This time I&#x27;m walking out the door","Or hear the sound when angels cry","What you said to me late last night","Every night when I close my eyes","And I want you to know that I&#x27;ll","Always be right here","Time stands still so do I leave me here","You&#x27;re always hanging around","Have all my questions been ignored","This time I&#x27;m walking out the door","Or hear the sound when angels cry","What you said to me late last night","Every night when I close my eyes","And I want you to know that I&#x27;ll","Always be right here","Always be here","Pull my credit right from the bottom","That road trip we took back in autumn","Or hear the sound when angels cry","What you said to me late last night","Every night when I close my eyes","And I want you to know that I&#x27;ll","Always be right here"],"song":"9394"}
