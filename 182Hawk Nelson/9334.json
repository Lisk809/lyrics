{"name":"Long Ago","cover":"Hawk Nelson","content":["Can we get back to the basics?","Back where we came from?","When we didn&#x27;t have no worries","We were basking in the sun","Sometimes the least of my problems","Feel like the biggest ones","When you said that you were leaving,","Felt like we had just begun","It would be so easy","Oh, if it was that easy","I can&#x27;t sleep tonight","So tell me one more time","Saw you out on the freeway,","And later at the show","It could be my imagination,","But I know I&#x27;m not alone","All the lights in the city","Are burning out with time","And it&#x27;s keeping us in line","It would be so easy","Oh, if it was that easy","I can&#x27;t sleep tonight","So tell me one more time","I can&#x27;t sleep tonight","So tell me one more time","Let&#x27;s take a look at the future","See where we left off","I&#x27;m so grateful that I found you","Cause, without you, I am lost"],"song":"9334"}
