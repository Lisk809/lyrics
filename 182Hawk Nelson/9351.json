{"name":"Not The Same","cover":"Hawk Nelson","content":["This evening at sundown","We meet in our small town","To meet for the countdown","Our friends and our families","All hangout at Riley&#x27;s","We stay for a while and jam out Guiel","Then walk on down George Street","And this road we choose","Nothing to lose at all","Gone are the old days","Now we&#x27;re on to something new","Our lives in the fast lane","It&#x27;s not the same without you","Shows at the Gordon Best","And hockey at Northcrest","Our malls were a disgrace","Remember Portage Place","When we got kicked out","And told to never show our face","This road we choose","Nothing to lose at all","Gone are the old days","Now we&#x27;re on to something new","Our lives in the fast lane","It&#x27;s not the same without you","We will keep","On our feet","In the streets that will never sleep","Gone are the old days","Now we&#x27;re on to something new","Our lives in the fast lane","It&#x27;s not the same without you","It&#x27;s not the same without you","It&#x27;s not the same without you"],"song":"9351"}
