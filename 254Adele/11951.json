{"name":"Melt My Heart To Stone","cover":"Adele","content":["Pulls me down turns me weak for you","And i give in to my pretendings","Which forgive you each time","Without me knowing","They melt my heart to stone","And i hear your words that i made up","I&#x27;m the only one in love","But instead i fall back to my knees","As you tear your way right through me","I forgive you once again","Without me knowing","You&#x27;ve burnt my heart to stone","And i hear your words that i made up","I&#x27;m the only one in love","Why do you steal my hand","You build me up  then leave me dead","Well i hear your words you made up","I&#x27;m the only one in love"],"song":"11951"}
