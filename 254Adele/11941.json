{"name":"Make You Feel My Love","cover":"Adele","content":["when the rain is blowing in your face","当雨水在你的脸上恣睢","and the whole world is on your case","你将整个世界背负在自己的行囊里","i could offer you a warm embrace","我会给你一个温暖的拥抱","to make you feel my love","让你感受我的爱","when evening shadows and stars appear","当夜幕降临，天上的繁星闪现","and there is no one to dry your tears","没有人拭去你眼角的泪水","i could hold you for a million years","我会紧紧的抱着你直到海枯石烂","to make you feel my love","让你感受我的爱","我知道你还没有下定决心","but i would never do you wrong","但我决不会做错事","我知道从我们相遇的那一刻起","no doubt in my mind where you belong","毫无疑问你在我心中的位置是多么的重要","我会为你风餐露宿，我会为你忧郁感伤","i&#x27;d go crawling down the avenue","我会为你在无人的小路蹒跚徜徉","没有什么我不可以做","to make you feel my love","让你感受我的爱","the storms are raging on a rolling sea","肆虐的暴风卷动着翻滚的海浪","and on the highway of regret","孤独的公路上","风儿在自由而狂野的流放","you ain&#x27;t see nothing like me yet","你会看到我的每个影象","我会让你开心，让美梦成真","没有什么我不可以做","go to the ends of the earth for you","我会为你走遍天涯海角","to make you feel my love","让你感受我的爱","to make you feel my love","让你感受我的爱"],"song":"11941"}
