{"name":"Hiding My Heart","cover":"Adele","content":["This is how the story went","这个故事就如此开始","I met someone by accident","我邂逅了陌生的你","Who blew me away  blew me away","让我怦然心动,让我魂牵梦萦","It was in the darkest of my days","那是我生命中最低潮的时期","当你驱散我的悲伤和我的痛苦","And buried them away  buried them away","将它们埋葬,将它们埋葬","我希望夜幕降临时我能躺在你身旁","醒来的时候，早晨的阳光映照你的脸","但是,正如我所知道的一切,总有一天你会消失不见","所以，我将倾尽一生来隐藏我的心","Drop you off at the train station","送你到车站","Put a kiss on top of your head","在你的额头上轻吻","Watch you wave  watched you wave","我看着你挥手告别,我看着你挥手告别","Then I went on home to my skyscrapers","然后我回到大楼林立 霓虹闪耀的都市","Neon lights and wedding papers","开始繁忙的生活","That I call home  I call that home","那便是我的归宿 我的归宿","我希望夜幕降临时我能躺在你身旁","醒来的时候，早晨的阳光映照你的脸","但是,正如我所知道的一切,总有一天你会消失不见","所以，我将倾尽一生来隐藏我的心","I woke up feeling heavy hearted","我醒来的时候感觉内心沉重","I&#x27;m going back to where I started","回到了原来的生活","The morning rain  morning rain","清晨雨纷纷,清晨雨纷纷","And though I wish that you were here","虽然我好希望你在离我不远的地方","That same old road that brought me here","在那条指引我到这里的熟悉路上","呼唤着我回去 唤我回去","我希望夜幕降临时我能躺在你身旁","醒来的时候，早晨的阳光映照你的脸","但是,正如我所知道的一切,总有一天你会消失不见","所以，我将倾尽一生来隐藏我的心","而我不能倾尽一生来隐藏我的心"],"song":"11938"}
