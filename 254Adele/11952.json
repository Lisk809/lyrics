{"name":"First Love","cover":"Adele","content":["So little to say but so much time","Please wear the face","The one where you smile","Because you lighten up my heart","When I start to cry","0I need to get away to feel again","Try to understand why","Please wipe that look out of your eyes","It&#x27;s bribing me to doubt myself","Simply it&#x27;s tiring","And if I stay I&#x27;ll be alive","Forgive me forgive me first love","Forgive me first love"],"song":"11952"}
