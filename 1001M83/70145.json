{"name":"Moonchild","cover":"M83","content":["They say I made the moon","Everything was in the dark","No memories at all","Just a tiny freezing wind in my back","And I was sitting there","Singing a song I had never heard before","Suddenly a voice told me","Keep on singing little boy","Raise your arms the highest you can","So the whole universe will glow","My first vision was a bush growing","Down the river","And I couldn&#x27;t stop crying","Something was missing","I realized I was in love with the voice","I called it again and again"],"song":"70145"}
