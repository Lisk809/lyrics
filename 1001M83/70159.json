{"name":"Raconte-moi une histoire","cover":"M83","content":["I heard about this frog","It&#x27;s a very tiny frog","But it&#x27;s also very special","You can only find it in the jungle","So far away from me","But if you find it and if you touch it","Your world can change forever","If you touch it&#x27;s skin","You can feel your body changing","And your vision also","Nothing is ever quite the same really","And after you finish laughing","It&#x27;s very funny to be a frog","You can dive into the water","Do you want to play with me","We can be a whole group of friends","A whole group of frogs","Jumping into the streets","Jumping into the planet","Climbing up the buildings","We would be hundreds thousands millions","Jumping and laughing forever","It would be great right"],"song":"70159"}
