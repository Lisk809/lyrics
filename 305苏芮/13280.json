{"name":"Changes","cover":"苏芮","content":["We used to walk hand in hand","In the pouring rhythm of the rain","We used to share each other&#x27;s joys","We used to share each other&#x27;s pain","But somehow things would change","I know you&#x27;re leaving","Don&#x27;t you know I live I die","I love I cry","I breathe and sing for you","I love to remember everything","My love we used to do","Forever I&#x27;ll pretend myself that","Always you&#x27;re been true","Believe in the foolish excuses","That I sadly made for you","So that&#x27;s the way it seems to be","With a melancholy girl like me","Before they see eternity","People hand in hand lost in confusion","They see illusion","And though I know by now you might be","Holding someone new","And hurting me by doing the things","My love we used to do","Forever I&#x27;ll pretend myself that","Always you&#x27;re been true","Believe in the foolish excuses","That I sadly made for you","And though I know by now you might be","Holding someone new","And hurting me by doing the things","My love we used to do","Don&#x27;t you know I live I die","I love I cry","I breathe and sing for you","I love to remember everything","My love we used to do","Forever I&#x27;ll pretend myself that","Always you&#x27;re been true","Believe in the foolish excuses","That I sadly made for you"],"song":"13280"}
