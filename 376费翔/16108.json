{"name":"FOR GOOD","cover":"费翔","content":["I&#x27;ve heard it said","Bringing something we must learn","And we are led","To those who help us most to grow","If we let them","And we help them in return","But i know i&#x27;m who i am today","Because i knew you","Like a comet pulled from orbit","As it passes a sun","Like a stream that meets a boulder","Halfway through the wood","Because i knew you","I have been changed for good","It well may be","That we will never meet again","In this lifetime","So let me say before we part","So much of me","Is made of what i learned from you","You&#x27;ll be with me","Like a handprint on my heart","And now whatever way our stories end","I know you have re written mine","By being my friend","By a wind off the sea","Like a seed dropped by a skybird","In a distant wood","Because i knew you","I have been changed for good","And just to clear the air","I ask forgiveness","And none of it seems to matter anymore","Like a comet pulled from orbit","As it passes a sun","Like a stream that meets a boulder","Halfway through the wood","Who can say","Because i knew you","Because i knew you","Because i knew you","I have been changed for good"],"song":"16108"}
