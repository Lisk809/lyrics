{"name":"为了这一天","cover":"王铮亮","content":["大半生晴空对雨帘","你在明我在暗","一条线平地对苍天","却无言的面对面","多少年逐鹿在中原","望绝尘又起了狼烟","抬头望前面","是一段视线中消失的地平线","我们用一辈子的时间","只为盼一夜月圆","温度都保存在心里面","为能和你坐下看看天","我们用一杯茶的时间","静静叙一生情缘","滋味都回荡在梦里","只为和你聊聊天","这辈子一日对千年","你心甘我情愿","一生事不变对万变","守情义在心里面","弹指间沧桑爬上脸","叹往事抵不过昨天","低头望前面是一段回忆中","模糊的海岸线","我们用一辈子的时间","只为盼一夜月圆","温度都保存在心里面","为能和你坐下看看天","我们用一杯茶的时间","静静叙一生情缘","滋味都回荡在梦里","只为和你聊聊天","我们用一辈子的时间","只为盼一夜月圆","温度都保存在心里面","为能和你坐下看看天","我们用一杯茶的时间","静静叙一生情缘","滋味都回荡在梦里","只为和你聊聊天"],"song":"23960"}
