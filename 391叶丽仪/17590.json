{"name":"Blessings","cover":"叶丽仪","content":["We pray for blessings we pray for peace","We pray for healing for prosperity","What if a thousand sleepless nights are","What it takes to know you&#x27;re near","We pray for wisdom your voice to hear","What if a thousand sleepless nights are","What it takes to know you&#x27;re near","When friends betray us","When darkness seems to win","We know that pain reminds this heart","That this is not","This is not our home","It&#x27;s not our home","What if a thousand sleepless nights are","What it takes to know you&#x27;re near","What if my greatest disappointments","Or the aching of this life","Is the revealing of a greater thirst","This world can&#x27;t satisfy","What if trials of this life","The rain the storms the hardest nights","Are your mercies in disguise"],"song":"17590"}
