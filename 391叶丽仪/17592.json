{"name":"Sometimes When We Touch","cover":"叶丽仪","content":["You ask me if I love you","And I choke on my reply","I&#x27;d rather hurt you honestly","Than mislead you with a lie","But who am I to judge you","On what you say or do","And sometimes when we touch","The honesty&#x27;s too much","And I have to close my eyes and hide","I wanna hold you &#x27;til I die","&#x27;Til we both break down and cry","Romance and all its strategy","Leaves me battling with my pride","And through the insecurity","Some tenderness survives","I&#x27;m just another writer","Still trapped within my truth","A hesitant prize fighter","Still trapped within my youth","And sometimes when we touch","The honesty&#x27;s too much","And I have to close my eyes and hide","I wanna hold you &#x27;til I die","&#x27;Til we both break down and cry","At times I&#x27;d like to break you","And drive you to your knees","At times I&#x27;d like to break through","And hold you endlessly","At times I understand you","Cos I know how hard you&#x27;ve tried","And I&#x27;ve watched love pass you by","At times I think we&#x27;re drifters","Still searching for a friend","A brother or a sister","But then the passion flares again","And sometimes when we touch","The honesty&#x27;s too much","And I have to close my eyes and hide","I wanna hold you &#x27;til I die","&#x27;Til we both break down and cry"],"song":"17592"}
