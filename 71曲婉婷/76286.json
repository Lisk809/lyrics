{"name":"Jar Of Love ","cover":"曲婉婷","content":["Another sunrise another sunset","Soon it&#x27;ll all be yesterday","Another good day another bad day","What did you do today","What you want isn&#x27;t what you have","What you have may not be yours to keep","If I could find love at a stop","In a park with open arms","I would save all my love","In a jar made of sparks sealed","In my beating heart","Another left turn another head turns","Could he be someone I deserve","Never leave an open flame to burn","What you want isn&#x27;t what you have","If I could find love at a stop","In a park with open arms","I would save all my love","In a jar made of sparks sealed","In my beating heart","Could you be my love","Could you be my love","Could you be my love","Could you be my love","Could you be her love","Could you be his love","Could you be my love","Could I be your love","If I could find love at a stop","In a park with open arms","I would save all my love","In a jar made of sparks sealed","In my beating heart","Could it be yours to keep","If I could find love at a stop","In a park with open arms","I would save all my love","In a jar made of sparks sealed","In my beating heart","Could it be yours to keep","If I could find love at a stop","In a park with open arms","I would save all my love"],"song":"76286"}
