{"name":"Lost","cover":"Katy Perry","content":["I&#x27;m out on my own again","Face down in the porcelain","Feeling so high but looking so low","Party favors on the floor","Group of girls banging on the door","Have you ever been so lost","Known the way and still so lost","Caught in the eye of a hurricane","So sick of this town pulling me down","Have you ever been so lost","Known the way and still so lost","Have you ever been so lost","Is there a light","Is there a light","At the end of the road","I&#x27;m pushing everyone away","Can&#x27;t feel this anymore","Have you ever been so lost","Known the way and still so lost","Have you ever been so lost","Have you ever been so lost"],"song":"25012"}
