{"name":"Spanish Eyes","cover":"Backstreet Boys","content":["Here we are in the arms of one another","Knowing that hate is wrong","And love is right for us tonight","When I look into your Spanish eyes","I know the reason why I am alive","And the world is so beautiful tonight","It&#x27;s a place I&#x27;ve never been","And it comes from deep within","Knowing all I have to do","Is reach out my hand to you","Let it be if nothing more than dreamers","When all I could find","When I look into your Spanish eyes","I know the reason why I am alive","And the world is so beautiful tonight","It&#x27;s a place I&#x27;ve never been","And it comes from deep within","Knowing all I have to do","Is reach out my hand to you","I loved you from a a distance","Thought I couldn&#x27;t reach that far","When I look into your Spanish eyes","And the world is so beautiful tonight","It&#x27;s a place I&#x27;ve never been","And it comes from deep within","Knowing all I have to do","Is reach out my hand to you","When I look into your Spanish eyes"],"song":"14063"}
