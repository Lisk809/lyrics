{"name":"You Wrote The Book On Love","cover":"Backstreet Boys","content":["Show Me The Meaning Of Being Lonely","So many words for the broken heart","It is hard to see in a crimson love","So hard to breathe","Walk with me and maybe","Nights to light so soon become","Wild and free I could feel the sun","Your every wish will be done","They tell me","Show me the meaning of being lonely","Is this the feeling I need to walk with","There is something missing in my heart","Life goes on as it never ends","Eyes of stone observe the trends","They never say forever gaze","Guilty roads to an endless love","There is no control","Are you with me now","Your every wish will be done","They tell me","Show me the meaning of being lonely","Is this the feeling I need to walk with","There is something missing in my heart","There is nowhere to run","I have no place to go","Surrender my heart body and soul","You are missing in my heart","Show me the meaning of being lonely","Is this the feeling I need to walk with","There is something missing in my heart","Show me the meaning of being lonely","Is this the feeling I need to walk with","There is something missing in my heart"],"song":"14052"}
