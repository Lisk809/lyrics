{"name":"What Now Mv Love","cover":"叶蒨文","content":["What now my love","Now that you left me","How can I live through another day","Watching my dreams turn into ashes","And all my hopes into bits of clay","Once I could see  once I could feel","Now I&#x27;m a numb","I&#x27;ve become unreal","I walk the night  oh  without a goal","Stripped of my heart  my soul","What now my love","Now that it&#x27;s over","I feel the world closing in on me","Here comes the stars","Tumbling around me","What now my love","Now that you&#x27;re gone","I&#x27;d be a fool to go on and on","No one would care  no one would cry","If I should live or die","What now my love","Now there is nothing","Only my last goodbye"],"song":"7913"}
