{"name":"Macarthur Park","cover":"叶蒨文","content":["Spring was never waiting for us dear","It ran one step ahead","As we followed in the dance","Between the parted pages","And were pressed","In love&#x27;s hot  fevered iron","Like a striped pair of pants","All the sweet  green icing flowing down","Someone left the cake out in the rain","I don&#x27;t think that I can take it","&#x27;Cause it took so long to bake it","Oh  no","I recall the yellow cotton dress","Foaming like a wave","On the ground beneath your knees","And the old men playing","Chinese checkers by the trees","All the sweet green icing flowing down","Someone left the cake out in the rain","I don&#x27;t think that I can take it","&#x27;Cause it took so long to bake it","Oh  no","There will be another song for me","And I will sing it","There will be another dream for me","Someone will bring it","I will drink the wine while it is warm","And never let you catch me","Looking at the sun","And after all the loves of my life","After all the loves of my life","You&#x27;ll still be the one","I will take my life into my hands","And I will use it","I will win the worship in their eyes","And I will lose it","I will have the things that I desire","And my passion flow like rivers","Through the sky","And after all the loves of my life","After all the loves of my life","Use to be the one","And I as myself why","All the sweet  green icing flowing down","Someone left the cake out in the rain","I don&#x27;t think that I can take it","&#x27;Cause it took so long to bake it","Oh  no","Oh  ho","Oh  ho"],"song":"7904"}
