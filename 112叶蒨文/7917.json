{"name":"Somethin’ Stupid","cover":"叶蒨文","content":["I know I stand in line","Until you think you have the time","To spend an evening with me","And if we go someplace to dance","I know that there&#x27;s a chance","You won&#x27;t be leaving with me","And have a drink or two","Then I go and spoil it all","By saying something stupid","Like I love you","I can see it in your eyes","That you despise the same old lies","You heard the night before","And though it&#x27;s just a line to you","For me it&#x27;s true","It never seemed so right before","To make the meaning come through","And I&#x27;m alone with you","The stars get red","And oh the night&#x27;s so blue","And then I go and spoil it all","By saying something stupid","Like I love you","I can see it in your eyes","That you despise the same old lies","You heard the night before","And though it&#x27;s just a line to you","For me it&#x27;s true","It never seemed so right before","To make the meaning come through","And I&#x27;m alone with you","The stars get red","And oh the night&#x27;s so blue","Then I go and spoil it all","By saying something stupid","Like I love you","I love you","I love you","I love you"],"song":"7917"}
