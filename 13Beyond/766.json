{"name":"无声的告别","cover":"Beyond","content":["无限唏嘘惜别天","含泪告别了无声","眸里倾出真挚心","凝望轻轻的嗟叹 难再聚","无奈空虚心里追","留下一丝丝回响","没法安于车厢中","遥望天边的一角 难再聚","风中飘着异土的引诱","细看朴素背影心痴醉","与你邂逅共对 与你进入梦里","点起恋火抚灼我 give me all I need","彼此相拥轻渗透 is fantasy","Oh fantasy forever","炎夏过后秋复返","如梦片段涌着心","夜里执笔写记忆","留下欢欣的忆记 难再聚","风中飘着异土的引诱","细看朴素背影心痴醉","与你邂逅共对 与你进入梦里","点起恋火抚灼我 give me all I need","彼此相拥轻渗透 is fantasy","Oh fantasy forever","点起恋火抚灼我 give me all I need","彼此相拥轻渗透 is fantasy","Oh fantasy forever","风中飘着异土的引诱","细看朴素背影心痴醉","与你邂逅共对 与你进入梦里","点起恋火抚灼我 give me all I need","彼此相拥轻渗透 is fantasy","Oh fantasy forever","点起恋火抚灼我 give me all I need","彼此相拥轻渗透 is fantasy","Oh fantasy forever"],"song":"766"}
