{"name":"Crying In My Sleep","cover":"周华健","content":["I took a walk around the yard","I dug the flowers till it got too hard","I put a half a case away","But you know baby the leading lady","And I woke up crying in my sleep","I was talking to your pillow","And I reached out to touch your hand","I knocked the phone off the night stand","You see I just had a bad dream","You see I just had a bad dream","Went out to loosen up the car","Somehow I wound up at the rainbow bar","I had a scotch and soda on the run","But didn&#x27;t get too far then I","I ran down down some friends","I used to know","I dragged them out to see the show","But you know baby","It look","And I woke up crying in my sleep","I was talking to your pillow","And I reached out to touch your hand","I knocked the phone off the night stand","You see I just had a bad dream","You see I just had a bad dream","You see I just had a bad dream"],"song":"3094"}
