{"name":"My Prayer","cover":"林子祥","content":["When the twilight is gone","And no songbirds are singing","When the twilight is gone","You come into my heart","And here in my heart you will stay","While I pray","My prayer is to linger with you","At the end of the day","In a dream that&#x27;s divine","My prayer is a rapture in blue","With the world far away","And your lips close to mine","Tonight while our hearts are aglow","My prayer and the answer you give","Tonight while our hearts are aglow","My prayer and the answer you give"],"song":"6500"}
