{"name":"HOLD ON THE NIGHTS","cover":"赵咏华","content":["Just when I believed","I couldn&#x27;t ever want for more","This ever changing world pushes me","Through another door","I saw your smile","Just for a while","Won&#x27;t you let me shelter you","Hold on to the nights","Hold on to the memories","Then I could be yours","What happens now","Do we break another rule","Let our lovers play the fool","I don&#x27;t know how","To stop feeling this way","Hold on to the nights","Hold on to the memories","If only I could give you more","Everytime I look into your eyes","I&#x27;m helplessly aware","Hold on to the nights","Hold on to the memories","If only I could give you more","Oh","Hold on to the nights"],"song":"61919"}
