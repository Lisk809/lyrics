{"name":"Almaz","cover":"赵咏华","content":["She only smiles","He only tells her","That she&#x27;s the flowers","The wind and spring","The love that innocence brings","Almaz pure and simple","Born in a world where love survives","Now men will want her","&#x27;Cause life don&#x27;t haunt her","Almaz you lucky lucky thing","Now I watch closely","And I watch wholly","I can&#x27;t imagine love so rare","She&#x27;s young and tender","But will life bend her","I look around is she everywhere","Almaz pure and simple","Born in a world where love survives","Now men will want her","&#x27;Cause life don&#x27;t haunt her","Almaz you lucky lucky thing","He throws her kisses","She shares his wishes","With love so captive","So solely captive","I ask if I could play the part","Almaz pure and simple","Born in a world where love survives","Now men will want her","&#x27;Cause life don&#x27;t haunt her","Almaz you lucky lucky thing"],"song":"61937"}
