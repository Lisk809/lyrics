{"name":"WIND BENEATH MY WINGS","cover":"赵咏华","content":["To never have sunlight on your face","You were content to let me shine","Thats your way","You always walk a step behind","So I was the one with all the glory","A beautiful smile can hide the pain","Did you ever know that youre my hero","And everthing I would like to be","I can fly higher than an eagle","Cause you are the wind beneath my wings","It might have appeared to go unnoticed","But Ive got it all here in my heart","I would be nothing without you","Did I ever tell you youre my hero","And everything I would like to be","I can fly higher than an eagle","Cause you are the wind beneath my wings","Did I ever tell you youre my hero","I can fly higher than an eagle","Cause you are the wind beneath my wings","Cause you are the wind beneath my wings","Oh the wind beneath my wings","Fly  fly so high again this time","So high I almost touch the sky","Thank you  thank you"],"song":"61908"}
