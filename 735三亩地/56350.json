{"name":"Cruel","cover":"三亩地","content":["Got to hide your frozen sorrow","Feeling like an empty world","Every bloody drop of rain","It was the sunny memory of these days","Still got time to do it all","To change myself","Cause only if you take it away","To face the truth","Just break the rules","All this force you to be cruel","Feeling like an empty sorrow","Conscious calls the painful souls","She&#x27;s being guided","With no directions run away","The sickle raised by the death","The endless road confuse your eyes","To do it all","To change myself","Cause only if you take it away","To face the truth","Just break the rules","All this force you to be cruel","To do it all","To change myself","Cause only if you take it away","To face the truth","Just break the rules","All this force you to be cruel","I got time for roller coaster","You got shady on deep inside","It make it trouble something special","I gotta find it out all rise"],"song":"56350"}
