{"name":"干妹妹","cover":"张震岳","content":["We hold hands in the movie show","Or we stroll beneath the silvery moon","We enjoy sitting side by side","In the booth in the ice cream parlor","Where we play the nickelodeon","But when it comes to love","I like what they did in the past","I&#x27;m the kind who loves only one","So the boys say I&#x27;m old fashioned","Let them laugh honey I don&#x27;t mind"],"song":"41340"}
