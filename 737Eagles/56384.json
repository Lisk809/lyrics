{"name":"Long Road Out Of Eden","cover":"Eagles","content":["Long Road Out of Eden","Music","Moon shinning down through the palms","Shadows moing on the sand","Dusty rifle in his trembling hands","Somebody tring just to stay alive","He got promsises to keep","Over the ocean in America","Far away and fast asleep","But it&#x27;s a long road out of Eden","Music blasting from an SUV","On a bright and sunny day","Rolling down the interstate","In the good ol&#x27;USA","Having lunch at the petroleum club","But it&#x27;s a long road out of Eden","Back home I was so certain","The path was very clear","I&#x27;m not counting on tomorrow","And I can&#x27;t tell wrong from right","Weaving down the American highway","And it&#x27;s a long road out of Eden","end"],"song":"56384"}
