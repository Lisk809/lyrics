{"name":"Lyin’s Eyes","cover":"Eagles","content":["City girls just seem to find out early","How to open doors with just a smile","You can′t hide your lyin′ eyes","And your smile is a thin disguise","I thought by now you′d realize","She whispers that it′s only for awhile","You can′t hide your lyin′ eyes","And your smile is a thin disguise","I thought by now you′d realize","Another night, it′s gonna be a long one","She wonders how it ever got this crazy","You set it up so well, so carefully","You can′t hide your lyin eyes","And your smile is a thin disguise","I thought by now you′d realize","Honey, you can′t hide your lyin′ eyes"],"song":"56422"}
