{"name":"You Belong To The City","cover":"Eagles","content":["The sun goes down","The night rolls in","You can feel it starting all over again","The moon comes up","And the music calls","You&#x27;re out of your room","And down on the street","The traffic roars","And the sirens scream","Nobody know where you&#x27;re going","Nobody cares where you&#x27;ve been","&#x27;Cause you belong to the city","You belong to the night","You were born in the city","Concrete under your feet","You&#x27;re a man of the street","When you said goodbye","You were on the run","Now you&#x27;re back again","And you&#x27;re feeling strange","&#x27;Cause you belong to the city","You belong to the night","You were born in the city","Concrete under your feet","You&#x27;re a man of the street","You can feel it","You can taste it","You can see it","You can face it","You can hear it","You&#x27;re getting near it","You want to make it","&#x27;Cause you can take it","You belong to the city","You belong to the night","You belong to the city","You belong to the night","You belong","You belong","You belong","You belong yeah"],"song":"56442"}
