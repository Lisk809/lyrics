{"name":"Take","cover":"Eagles","content":["All alone at the end of the evening","Loved me and I never knew","spent my life running &#x27;round","And it&#x27;s so hard to change","can&#x27;t seem to settle down","But the dreams I&#x27;ve seen lately","Keep on turning out and burning out","And turning out the same","So put me on a highway","And show me a sign","And take it to the limit one more time","You can spend all your love making time","If it all fell to pieces tomorrow","Would you still be mine","nobody seems to care","And you can&#x27;t find the door","can&#x27;t find it anywhere","When there&#x27;s nothing to believe in","So put me on a highway","And show me a sign","And take it to the limit one more time","Take it to the limit","Take it to the limit","Take it to the limit one more time"],"song":"56559"}
