{"name":"Teenage Jail","cover":"Eagles","content":["Stare out the window","You can apost make the time go","And make everything disappear","You aposre lost in a teenage jail","So you and so vicious and so frail","Where something is always for sale","You aposre lost in a teenage jail","You aposre not like your mothers","You aposre not like the others","You aposre not quite like anyone else","They don aposi even know you","Got nothing to show you","So get something good for yourself"],"song":"56465"}
