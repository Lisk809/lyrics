{"name":"Never   Knows  Tomorrow  ","cover":"朴树","content":["早上的房间是安静的","不重要的一天又开始了","当阳光照着","并不急着开放的百合","它像一首不喧闹的歌","我多愿让时光这么溜走","就这么溜走","咖啡在手边还是热的","眼睛是肿的像刚哭过","是的今天有今天要完成的功课","而明天有明天的烦忧","就让它去船自然到桥头","让船到桥头","Never knows tomorrow","Never knows tomorrow","Never knows tomorrow","待到回头看谁猜了错","Never knows tomorrow","睡醒的午后玩耍的狗","窗外海棠树叶还没飘落","若明天相守","我愿和你共醉美酒","可如果你要离我远走","只留下我独自来唱离愁","独自唱离愁","Never knows tomorrow","Never knows tomorrow","Never knows tomorrow","且今日来醉今日的酒","Never knows tomorrow","就等你笑着说哪有不同","Never knows tomorrow"],"song":"36262"}
