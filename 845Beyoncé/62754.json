{"name":"Pretty Hurts","cover":"Beyonc√©","content":["Mr third world your first question","What is your aspiration in life","Oh my aspiration in life","Would be to be happy","Mama said you&#x27;re a pretty girl","Brush your hair fix your teeth","What you wear is all that matters","This time I&#x27;m gonna take the crown","Without falling down down","Blonder hair flat chest","TV says bigger is better","South beach sugar free","Vogue says thinner is better","Just another stage","Pageant the pain away","This time I&#x27;m gonna take the crown","Without falling down down down","It&#x27;s my soul that needs surgery","When you&#x27;re alone all by yourself","And you&#x27;re lying in your bed","Reflection stares right into you","Are you happy with yourself","It&#x27;s just a way to masquerade","The illusion that&#x27;s been shed","Are you happy with yourself","Are you happy with yourself yes"],"song":"62754"}
