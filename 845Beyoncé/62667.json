{"name":"Sweet Dreams","cover":"Beyonc√©","content":["Every night i rush to my bed","When i close my eyes","I&#x27;m going out of my head","Lost in a fairytale","Can you hold my hands and be my guide","And i hope it rains","You&#x27;re the perfect lullaby","What kinda dream am is this","Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare","Baby long as you&#x27;re here","I mention you when i say my prayers","Boy you&#x27;re my temporary high","To wrap your arms around me for real","And tell me you&#x27;ll stay by side","And i hope it rains","You&#x27;re the perfect lullaby","What kinda dream is this","Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare","Baby long as you&#x27;re here","Tattoo your name across my heart","So it will remain","Not even death can make us part","What kind of dream is this","Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare","Baby long as you&#x27;re here"],"song":"62667"}
