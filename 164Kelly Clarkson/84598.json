{"name":"Heartbeat Song","cover":"Kelly Clarkson","content":["You where the hell did you come from","And I&#x27;m so used to feeling numb","Anticipating what&#x27;s to come","Like a finger on a loaded gun","I can feel it rising","Temperature inside me","Haven&#x27;t felt it for a lifetime","Your hands on my hips","And my kiss on your lips","Oh I could do this for a lifetime","I can feel it rising","Temperature inside me","Haven&#x27;t felt it for a lifetime","Your hands on my hips","And my kiss on your lips","Oh I could do this for a lifetime","I I wasn&#x27;t even gonna go out","But I never would have had a doubt","Anticipating what&#x27;s to come","Like a finger on a loaded gun","I can feel it rising","Temperature inside me","Haven&#x27;t felt it for a lifetime","Your hands on my hips","And my kiss on your lips","Oh I could do this for a lifetime","I can feel it rising","Temperature inside me","Haven&#x27;t felt it for a lifetime","Your hands on my hips","And my kiss on your lips","Oh I could do this for a lifetime"],"song":"84598"}
