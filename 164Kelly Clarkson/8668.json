{"name":"Walking After Midnight","cover":"Kelly Clarkson","content":["I go out walking after midnight","I&#x27;m always walking after midnight","Searching for you","I walk for miles along the highway","I&#x27;m always walking after midnight","Searching for you","I stopped to see a weeping willow","Crying on his pillow","Maybe he&#x27;s crying for me","And as the skies turn gloomy","The night winds whisper to me","I&#x27;m lonesome as I can be","I go out walking after midnight","Out in the starlight","Just hoping you may be somewhere","I stopped to see a weeping willow","Crying on his pillow","Maybe he&#x27;s crying for me","And as the skies turn gloomy","The night winds whisper to me","I&#x27;m lonesome as I can be","In the moonlight","Just hoping you may be somewhere","I&#x27;m always walking after midnight","Searching for me"],"song":"8668"}
