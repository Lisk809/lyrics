{"name":"First Of May","cover":"张学友","content":["Some one else moved in from far away","And you don ask the time of day","But you and I our love will never die","But guess we cry come first of May","The apple tree that grew for you and me","I watched the apples falling one by one","And I recall the moment of them all","And you don ask the time of day","But you and I our love will never die","But guess we cry come first of May","Do do do do do do do do do"],"song":"74135"}
