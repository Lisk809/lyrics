{"name":"I Go To Pieces","cover":"张学友","content":["Baby","When i see you walking down the street","I get so shaky and i feel so weak","I tell my eyes look the other way","And i go to pieces and i wanna hide","Go to pieces and i almost die","Everytime my baby passes by","I tell my arms to hold someone new","Another love that will be true","But they don&#x27;t listen","They don&#x27;t seem to care","They reach for her but she not there","And i go to pieces and i wanna hide","Go to pieces and i almost die","Everytime my baby passes by","I remember what you said","When you said goodbye baby","We meet again soon may be","But until we do all my best to you","I so lonely i think about you only","I go to pieces we used to go","But i know you never show","You hurt me so much inside","How i hope you satisfied","And i go to pieces and i wanna hide","Go to pieces and i almost die","Everytime my baby passes by","Go to pieces and i and i die","Go to pieces and i wanna hide","Go to pieces and i my baby"],"song":"74041"}
