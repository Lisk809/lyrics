{"name":"Miles to go","cover":"Celine Dion","content":["我会为你走到天涯海角","为你描绘天边的朝阳","我会为你学遍人间的语言","为你吟诵揭示真理的十四行诗","我再也不会信其他的神","只会相信连接你我的道路","Every step i take for you","相信我为你走的每一步","I will always defend  never pretend","我会守卫每一个为爱情的呼吸","That every breath i take for love","从不做作","我不会犯错，道路很长","在我休息前，还有很多路要走","我会为你去找寻直布罗陀的石头","像鹅卵石一样，抛到天空","我会为你修造一座跨越大洋的大桥","但我最好的礼物，还是依偎在你身边","会有关于我们的流言蜚语","但那无法阻挡我们的爱情","Every step i take for you","还有我为你走的每一步","I will always defend  never pretend","我会守卫每一个为爱情的呼吸","That every breath i take for love","从不做作","我不会犯错，道路很长","在我休息前，还有很多路要走","我不会半途而废","我会让河流流到世界的最高处"],"song":"17066"}
