{"name":"Thankful","cover":"Celine Dion","content":["Soak around like butterflies","Escape from pouring rain","Running to the alley ways","Steel them with a kiss again","You&#x27;re my only weakness","But somehow you made me strong","After chasing ghost and fairytales","I&#x27;m right where I belong","But I&#x27;m thankful to be here","Thankful to feel free","Thankful my prayers have been answered","I&#x27;m thankful you listened","Thankful to heaven","Thankful my heart always need","Of who wants who and what is true","No one ever takes the blame","I see you through the window","And it takes my breath away","And all that&#x27;s left to say","Is I don&#x27;t know where I was going","But I&#x27;m thankful to be here","Thankful to feel free","Thankful my prayers have been answered","I&#x27;m thankful you listened","Thankful to heaven","Thankful for feeling alive again","Thankful my heart always need","And I caught rainbows","Falling down","When it&#x27;s down  spinning","Round and around and around","But I&#x27;m thankful to be here","Thankful to feel free","Thankful my prayers have been answered","I&#x27;m thankful you listened","Thankful to heaven","Thankful my heart always need","Thankful my heart always need"],"song":"16809"}
