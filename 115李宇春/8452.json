{"name":"漂浮地铁","cover":"李宇春","content":["当半个地球外还有个你","当世界下着雨我在这里","在人海中旅行哪管天气","但我们那一天变成记忆","爱浪费一颗心多少力气","天叫我要去看更多事情","在未来中流浪没有目的","我只剩一滴泪捏在心里","We are half a world away","让我坐上漂浮地铁走下去 也想着你","We are half a world away","时间带走一切 但是抛下一个谜","它要我乘着风","一公里的回忆飘成空气","一双手要多苦才能弹琴","分开两边的梦也有意义","我往哪里飞没有关系","We are half a world away","让我坐上漂浮地铁走下去 也想着你","We are half a world away","时间带走一切 但是抛下一个谜","它要我乘着风","穿过夜我飞过海","地图上所有地方我都停一夜","往事说别回来","我也许可以","Half a world away","让我坐上漂浮地铁想念你 也忘了你","We are half a world away","再看天空一眼 但是缺少一个你","像云海里的风","后来的我想起从前那个你","Come back to me","We are half a world away","后来的雨都像是在弹钢琴","很美也很痛"],"song":"8452"}
