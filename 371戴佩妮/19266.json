{"name":"好想","cover":"戴佩妮","content":["我写了张字条在你半开抽屉里面","在你还没有睡醒之前偷偷写的","我留了件衣服在你衣橱的左边","只为了证明我到过你的房间","我做了份早餐 摆在厨房的桌面","想让你可以幸福一点 再幸福多一点","我留了一个吻 在你额头的中间","我说了些话 但不是Say再见","说好想 告诉你","That I love you so","好想告诉你","That I need you","告诉你 I belong to you know","好想好好的待在你口袋里面","从这一秒起我想我不是谁的","你送我的钱币 已作成一条项链","一直靠在我心旁边 贴在胸前","拍下你的鬼脸 收在皮夹的某边","所在的位置比钞票还重要一点","这糖果叫思念 放进你的嘴巴里面","一口一口的慢慢咀嚼 红的绿的","要将你的世界 通通灌进电脑里面","你的占有欲 好奇怪 我不会讨厌","说好想 告诉你","That I love you so","好想告诉你","That I need you","告诉你 I belong to you know","好想好好的待在你口袋里面","从这一秒起我想我不是谁的","说好想 告诉你","That I love you so","好想告诉你","That I need you","告诉你 I belong to you know","好想好好的待在你口袋里面","从下一秒起我想我只是你的"],"song":"19266"}
